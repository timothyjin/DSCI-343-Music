Beautiful,Eminem,156067463,"Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me? Then I'm reaching out for you  I'm just so fuckin' depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump I took my bruises, took my lumps Fell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up In order for me to pick the mic back up I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in I'm starting to feel distant again So I decided just to pick this pen Up and try to make an attempt to vent But I just can't admit Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap I need a new outlet And I know some shit's so hard to swallow But I just can't sit back and wallow In my own sorrow, but I know one fact: I'll be one tough act to follow One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow Here today, gone tomorrow But you'd have to walk a thousand miles  In my shoes, just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes  But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you  I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor Everything's so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature Of the room, just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me So I try to avoid any eye contact Cause if I do that, then it opens a door For conversation like I want that I'm not lookin' for extra attention I just wanna be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fuckin' man servant Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, 'Ha! Marshall, you're so funny, man You should be a comedian, goddamn!' Unfortunately I am I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles  In my shoes, just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes  But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you  Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves And flip 'em, don't expect no help Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which I'm placed in And get up and get my own I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant acting stupid Aunt Edna always told me: 'Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.' Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this 'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old I learned my lesson then Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo' But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description Cause where you see it from where you're sittin' It's probably 110% different I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least What size you wear? I wear 10's Let's see if you can fit your feet  In my shoes, just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes  But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you  Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me? Then I'm reaching out for you  Yeah, to my babies: stay strong Daddy'll be home soon And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful"

But change is inevitable One reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do Just because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever If you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends"

Window Pain - Outro,J. Cole,54433599,"One night When me and my mom was about to go to bed All the doors was locked Then when I had fell asleep My mom had heard three gun shots It was to my cousin, his name was Rod The one that came to pick me up He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck And he got shot right in the stomach  I put my hand to the sky, I sing Grateful for the blessings you bring Thank you for the ones I love Forgive me for the times I was Down and confused, I know What I reap is what I will sow Once again I find myself Back with you from my hell All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry  Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane? Have I sacrificed for fame? My occupation's on my brain Thought that I could change it all if I had change But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing? I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin' That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead Shootin' up where his granny live, 'blaow, blaow!', his granny duck He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up? He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways The results are deadly Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me The little girl I met this past summer said, 'Don't forget me' I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through? A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue? If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through  I put my hand to the sky, I sing Grateful for the blessings you bring Thank you for the ones I love Forgive me for the times I was Down and confused, I know What I reap is what I will sow Once again I find myself Back with you from my hell All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry  It's not that big Well at least, um God had saved him 'cause he still alive So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen? Like why can't the world just be all nice things? Because God is tryna, um Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world K.O.D Choose wisely!"

(Express yourself)  I'm expressing with my full capabilities And now I'm living in correctional facilities Cause some don't agree with how I do this I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary But my technique is very necessary Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky When you got a subject and a predicate Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think Some suckers just tickle me pink To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this Some drop science, well I'm dropping English Even if Yella makes it a cappella I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel  Express yourself Come on and do it  Now, getting back to the PG That's program, and it's easy Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself It's crazy to see people be What society wants them to be, but not me Ruthless is the way to go, they know Others say rhymes that fail to be original Or they kill where the hip-hop starts Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts Some musicians cuss at home But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none They rather exaggerate a little fiction Some say no to drugs and take a stand But after the show they go looking for the dopeman Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say 'Hell no!' But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...  Express yourself Come on and do it  From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart Then expression is a big part of it You ain't efficient when you flow You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis There's a little bit more to show I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo Or a lesson, all of 'em expression And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you I might ignore your record because it has no bottom I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn It's Dre on the mic, getting physical Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus Or a tumor but here's the rumor Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket I got knowledge and other suckers lack it So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health But I won't strike if you just  Express yourself Come on and do it"

He said, 'There's things that I wanna fix But you know this shit, nigga: politics.'

Tired of livin' here, destitution Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution? I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed But see, it's not that simple I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature While this instrumental played Then I realized somethin' that made Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way The children in abusive households grow up Knockin' girlfriends out coldthat's called a cycle Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go So understand You get the power, but you know what power does to man? Corruption always leads us to the same shit again So when you talk 'bout revolution Dawg, I hear just what you sayin' What good is takin' over When we know what you gon' do?

Lifesaver,Guru,5141661,"Mmm, is this really the end, or is it a new beginning? A new reality..

Chorus  Oh I am, the life (I.. am the lifesaver) I am, the life.. yeah  It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight Than to set one off, knowledge I'll let some off Cause nowadays, everybody's a killer And as for me, no other MC is iller But still a thorn scrapes my heart When I see another life that's been torn apart Over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence That the money only takes precedence Cause everybody wants power While the innocent are born or die, during every hour I scowl as I look upon evil But I must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people And we will learn to respect our neighbors Another message from the lifesaver The lifesaver.. Chorus  People talk about the Armaggedeon And nowadays everyone you know is packin lead son Each day's another test Aiyyo I better do my best, cause a lot's ridin on my chest So when I lead you to the water, you best know How to swim across, so you can reach the border It's international, the message and the flavor So here's some more important words from the lifesaver The lifesaver.. (I am the life) The lifesaver..  Garon, fch, grandissant dans la violence et la pisse Le mot peace, c'est pour ceux qui prissent Chaque jour, aux alentours, dans le monde et ses tours En prison ou retour en arrire dans les fours Et les conds font leur rondes, les villes grondent La terre chauffe les sommets de montagne fondent Blondin a passe black a casse Tel est mon uniforme dans une guerre entre races On me regarde, me met en garde,  vue Certains cafardent, d'autres bavardent, et tuent Ddicace  tout quartier, toute cit, aux pas de chance  ceux qui sont tombs mais pas pour la France Pays trop bidon, vivement Armageddon J'ai raison, priant Jhovah pour mon pardon Car si un flic me juge je le droite Enfonant mon doigt dans son oeil et le fond de son cerveau je gratte ... (Goes off to fade)  So many misconceptions So many evil deceptions I've come to give direction For I, am the lifesaver"

The world looks dreary When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly There's no need for you to fear me If you take your time to hear me Maybe you can learn to cheer me It ain't about black or white, cause we human I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel  Those who wish to follow me (Ghetto gospel) I welcome with my hands And the red sun sinks at last Into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior Without the sound of guns  Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad? Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy Guess who's givin' birth to a baby? I don't trip or let it fade me From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery Even now I get discouraged Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage? I refuse to be a role model I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles I make mistakes but learn from every one And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one If I upset you, don't stress Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet I feel His hand on my brain When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang But am I less holy 'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies? Before we find world peace We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets My ghetto gospel  Those who wish to follow me (Yeah, ghetto gospel) I welcome with my hands And the red sun sinks at last Into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior Without the sound of guns  Lord, can you hear me speak?

Just a Friend,Biz Markie,68961386,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date But a year to make love she wanted you to wait? Let me tell ya a story of my situation I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert She had long hair and a short miniskirt I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met I whispered in her ear, 'Come to the picture booth So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof' I asked her her name, she said: 'Blah-blah-blah' She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused I said: 'How do you like the show?' She said: 'I was very amused' I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange Then when I asked, 'Do ya have a man?', she tried to pretend She said: 'No, I don't, I only have a friend' Come on! I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing  You, you got what I need But you say he's just a friend And you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend  So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime 'Cause I have friends and that's a fact Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack Forget about that, let's go into the story About a girl named 'blah-blah-blah' that adored me So we started talkin', gettin' familiar Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build up A relationship or some understanding How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin' Everything sounded so dandy and sweet I had no idea I was in for a treat After this was established, everything was cool The tour was over and she went back to school I called every day to see how she was doin' Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin' I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again I say: 'Yo, who was that?' 'Oh, he's just a friend' Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that! Jus' bust this  You, you got what I need But you say he's just a friend And you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend  So, I came to her college on a surprise visit To see my girl, that was so exquisite It was a school day, I knew she was there The first semester of the school year I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm This guy made me fill out a visitor's form He told me where it was and I was on my way To see my baby doll, I was happy to say I arrived in front of the dormitory 'Yo, could you tell me where is door three?' They showed me where it was for the moment I didn't know I was in for such an event So, I came to her room and opened the door Oh, snap! Guess what I saw? A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth I was so in shock, my heart went down south So please, listen to the message that I send Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend..."

There's Alot Going On,Vic Mensa,16958948,"Yeah, this just my life Front to back, top to bottom  Everything's changing around me These days don't feel the same We all lost faith and lost family Why must we play this game? Lord have mercy on me I've been a sinning man Pull out my wings, jump off the bridge And crash in a plane, if I never land  Know I never die We live forever in my mind And I sanctify We live forever, still alive  There's a lot going on but I stick to the ones I love I never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was Consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressing out It was like, May, I just moved to L.A., I was tryna figure it out Medication for depression that I cut cold turkey, had the kid manic In an episode out in Hollywood, wilding out like Nick Cannon Railing Adderall pills out a dollar bill, on the bathroom floor Clean the whole mess up with my nose, what the fuck I need a vacuum for? New York City on my birthday, June 6th, 2014 I had that first meeting with Hov, plus I brought out the whole team I drank that whole bottle of D'usse Ty Ty gave me that night When we left the club, at the Rap Genius house me and shorty got into a fight She came out the room swingin', hit me in the jaw I was really tryna fend her off But I ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck I was tripping, dawg Too proud to apologize or empathize, I blamed it all on her Saying that she hit me first, even though she was the one hurt I was really just reflecting all the hurt that I was feeling from the band's rejection When Kids These Days split, that shit felt like a c-section And my infidelity and jealousy with Natalie on top of the amphetamines And the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the Chesapeake The next month I dropped 'Down on My Luck' and had Europe going nuts But I couldn't even appreciate it at the time, I was going through too much Now I had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records In Ibiza eating paella on the roof, tryna choose over breakfast Hov wasn't with the bidding war, but I knew the Roc just felt right When I saw Kanye at Wireless, without T-Pain, still a good life Felt so close when Mr. Hudson introduced me to him backstage He prolly don't even remember that shit... like a bitch off Backpage But at that stage, I was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage At the same time, I was winding down a low point in my addict phase The Adderall started wearing off and I went into a deep writer's block All over a song that I couldn't finish that I wrote about signin' to the Roc Isn't that ironic? I was feeling so psychotic With the whole world excited for me and my idol saying I got it Shit got bad out in L.A., so I moved back home to my mom's basement Linked up with Smoko and Papi Beatz and took it back to basics Then I wrote 'Rage,' that was me screaming out through the pain And 'U Mad,' addressing my relationship with Natalie, it was too bad The violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health I did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself As I started to fall apart, certain stars started to align Om'Mas came to Chicago in January at the perfect time He said Kanye was working on an album, and Uzi played him one of our songs He was tryna fly me out, nigga, it was goin' down like the Dow Jones Pulled up to Westlake, first day I was there, I recorded 'Wolves' I knew I was the one, like Neo meeting with the Oracle But I had to get a handle 'fore the door was pulled Crawled out on SNL All the niggas hating on me back home lookin' at me like, 'FML' A lot of people coming out the wood like, 'Let's work,' tryna network All the pressure making my head hurt, the molly wouldn't let the meds work At this time it's like Feb. 1st to the 15th, and I'm still addicted Frustrated, writing shit for Ye, tryna visualize someone else's vision Then he laid that verse on 'U Mad' and we made the shit the single Ye and Hov getting into it over me, tryna do a joint venture And G.O.O.D. Music still fam, but it's that Roc boy SAVEMONEY life Took the bus out on the road for the Traffic tour, did a hundred nights Cleaned out my closet, I got rid of all of my demons If you learn one thing from my journey, nigga it's don't stop believing When this shit got so suffocating I could barely even keep breathing Wrote my wrongs all in this song now I'd like to welcome y'all to my season Nigga I'm gone  Know I never die We live forever in my mind And I sanctify We live forever, still alive"

Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah  Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin' No fairy tales for this young black male Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales Hustlers hardly think of culture Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures Why shed tears?

Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!  Smile for me, won't you smile? Just smile, smile for me Smile for me Won't you smile?

Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us Hit us off, give us plenty centuries Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries The best revenge is 'Fuck friends!'  we military minded soldiers Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain Embrace my words, make the world change And still I smile, nigga  And now a moment of silence, let us pray And as you journey into outerspace May the angels help to lead the way May the prayers that our families made Shine up on your soul to keep you safe And all the homies that done passed away They there to greet you as you pass the gates And as you headed to the tunnel's light I hope it leads to eternal life We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac  Smile, smile for me All you need to do is smile Woooo smile for me Come on, smile for me"

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic He feels so unlike everybody else, alone In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary It's all about reality and making some noise Making a story, making sure his clique stays up That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up, let's go  Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps Put it together himself, now the picture connects Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist  This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method 'Name of the Game' Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church I like 'Bleach', man, Ryu had the stupidest verse This dude is the truth, now, everybody givin' him guest spots His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot  This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spittin' fire with Mike Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat  Tak, he's not your everyday on the block He knows how to work with what he's got Making his way to the top He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him 'Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?' No, he's living proof, got him rocking the booth He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice Him and his crew are known around as one of the best Dedicated to what they do, they give a hundred percent  Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard It seems like he's never got time Because he writes every note and he writes every line And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind It's like a design is written in his head, every time Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed? Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?  This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  Yeah!

Back In The Day,Ahmad Lewis,3167249,"TITLE SEQUENCE CUT TO: STAIRS LEADING TO SUBWAY A number of people leave the subway. JESSICA: (Narrating) All it takes is one word, one suggestion, and they're no longer in control. All they know is a singular, intense need to follow me. Jessica examines a photograph, taken of her from the top of the stairs. JESSICA: (Narrating) To photograph me. To not get caught. Cut to a busy intersection. Jessica holds another photograph. She looks around, figuring out where it was taken from. JESSICA: (Narrating) Kilgrave's spy has no distractions, just an acute focus on me. Fortunately, not Luke. No photos of him. He should be safe. Jessica's cellphone vibrates. She looks at her phone. JESSICA: Shit. CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT Jessica exits the elevator. Malcolm is trying to get into his apartment. A woman is outside Jessica's. The woman turns around. AUDREY: Jessica Jones? JESSICA: Yeah? AUDREY: Audrey Eastman. I know I'm early. I just want to get this over with. JESSICA: You mentioned your divorce lawyer referred you. I'd love to thank him. What was his name? AUDREY: Desmond Tobey. He's at Hogarth, Chao, & Benowitz. I hope you're as good as he says you are. JESSICA: I am. AUDREY: So is that sign just for show, or do you actually have an office? Jessica takes out her keys. Behind her, Malcolm drops his. AUDREY: That man has been trying to get into his apartment for, like, five minutes. Nice building. Audrey walks into Jessica's apartment. Jessica walks over to Malcolm. JESSICA: Hey. You good? MALCOLM: You care? Jessica unlocks his apartment for him. JESSICA: Just don't wanna be another reason for you to get high. MALCOLM: Don't need a reason. Cut back to Jessica's apartment. Jessica sits at her desk, Audrey stands across from her. AUDREY: Carlo thinks I'm an idiot. But I can smell it on him every time he sneaks into bed at 3:00 in the morning. Wouldn't be his first affair, either. Some people can't keep their lives in check. They just go along blindly ruining the lives of everyone in their path. I'm sick of pretending it doesn't matter. How long have you been in business? JESSICA: Why do you ask? AUDREY: I want to know that if I write you a check, you'll stick around long enough to earn it. JESSICA: I'll earn it. AUDREY: Sorry... It's Carlo. I thought I'd gotten used to his lies and his wandering penis. My lawyer says that I need pictures for the divorce, of Carlo and his... JESSICA: Mistress. AUDREY: Skank! Nothing plays like pictures in court. He'll ask for alimony. I'm not giving him shit! I need you to catch him in flagrante. You know, in the act - JESSICA: I know what in flagrante means. AUDREY: Carlo says he's meeting a client Friday night. Of course, when I asked his assistant, she knew nothing about it. Follow him after work, I guarantee he will go straight form the office to her. JESSICA: The kind of pictures you're asking for, they're hard to look at. They're harder to forget. AUDREY: That's what I pay my shrink for. JESSICA: Circle of life. AUDREY: Look, I... I don't care if you have to knock down his door to do it. I want you to get those pictures! In fact, I want him to know that he is being photographed. JESSICA: So that's it? Follow your husband and take sex pictures? AUDREY: Isn't that enough? JESSICA: And your divorce lawyer. Dexter... AUDREY: Desmond Tobey. JESSICA: Tobey, right. He referred you to me himself? AUDREY: Yes, I already told you that! JESSICA: And you haven't had any conversations with a British man? Dark hair, well dressed? AUDREY: What? JESSICA: Standard contract. I require a 50% deposit up front. Audrey stands for a moment, then goes over to her purse. Jessica's phone vibrates. JESSICA: Hey. TRISH: He's back. JESSICA: Trish, what's going on? TRISH: He knows I'm alive. Outside of Trish's apartment is Simpson and another officer. TRISH: Kilgrave sent that, that cop back to kill me. There's two of them, and they're right outside. JESSICA: Go to your safe room. I'm on my way. TRISH: Okay. Trish runs to her safe room. Cut to outside her apartment. Simpson is trying to try to knock down the door, while some of Trish's neighbors look on. The other officer comes out of the elevator. OFFICER: Hey, Sarge, the doorman doesn't have the key. He said it's some kind of reinforced security door. SIMPSON: Get the ram. Cut to Trish's balcony. Jessica climbs over the side. Trish runs out of her safe room to let Jessica in. TRISH: They're still here. Jessica and Trish walk over to her front door. Outside, Simpson is trying to break the door down with a battering ram. OFFICER: Everybody clear the hall, please. You sure there's a body in there? SIMPSON: I'm sure. JESSICA: Kilgrave didn't send him back. TRISH: Then why is he trying to break down my door? JESSICA: He thinks he killed you. I recognize that look. Simpson continues to hit the door. Jessica opens it. SIMPSON: It's you. OFFICER: Um, sarge, that's not Trish Walker. SIMPSON: No, no, this is the one who - JESSICA: Sorry, we had our headphones in. I'm helping Trish make a party mix. Everything okay? SIMPSON: You're with Ms. Walker? TRISH: Yes, she's with me. This is my apartment. OFFICER: Are you all right ma'am? TRISH: I'm fine. OFFICER: Any violent incidents we should know about? Anybody try to hurt you? TRISH: I think I would know if I'd been attacked. OFFICER: We're real sorry for the disturbance, Ms. Walker. Uh, by the way, really big fan of your show back in the day. (Singing) It's Patsy! I really wanna be your friend - TRISH: That's sweet, thanks for watching. OFFICER: We gotta go Sarge. SIMPSON: Oh, uh, wait, I... I don't understand. No, no, no. OFFICER: Hey, Sergeant, take it easy. SIMPSON: You gotta tell me what's going on. Tell me what's happening. OFFICER: Hey, come on man, leave the lady alone. JESSICA: It's fine, he can stay. The other officer leaves. Trish looks worried. SIMPSON: I mean, how can you be standing here? How can you be alright? Trish removes her scarf to reveal bruises on her neck. TRISH: I am not alright! JESSICA: Trish, come on. SIMPSON: I'm... I'm a goddamn monster. Simpson begins to leave. Jessica closes the door and follows him. Trish listens to their conversation from inside her apartment. JESSICA: She knows it wasn't you. She's just being dramatic. TRISH: Dramatic? JESSICA: Come on. You could use some air. Jessica leads him to the elevator. CUT TO: OUTSIDE Jessica and Simpson walk around a park. JESSICA: She's alive. You've seen it. The best thing you can do for her is stay away. SIMPSON: No, I felt her dying in my hands. She was dead. Jessica pulls out the Sufentanil. JESSICA: Sufentanil. It knocks people out. This is what made you think that you killed Trish. SIMPSON: You know, I've spent my whole life protecting people. JESSICA: You're still you. You just need time to - SIMPSON: I did things in the line of duty, horrible things, but I have never wanted to kill an innocent woman. JESSICA: Do you want to kill her now? SIMPSON: No, God, no! JESSICA: No, because you never did. Kilgrave wanted it. SIMPSON Kilgrave? JESSICA: And he made you do it. SIMPSON: Well, how? JESSICA: It doesn't matter how. He told you to jump, you jumped. He's done with you. SIMPSON: Well, he also told me to kill Ms. Walker. Is he done with her, too? JESSICA: Look, just go home, go to sleep, and move on. SIMPSON: What happens when he finds out that she's still alive? JESSICA: I'll handle it. SIMPSON: He'll send somebody else, won't he? It won't end till we stop him! JESSICA: It will end when I stop it. You have no idea what's involved here. SIMPSON: Well, I know there's a guy who controls minds, and there's a woman who flew out of the sky to save my life. Jessica begins to leave. Simpson grabs her. SIMPSON: I may not have your abilities, but I've got eight years Special Ops and an entire police force to back me up. Jessica grabs his arm. JESSICA: No police. I will handle it. You're not gonna make her feel safe, Sergeant. Go home. I got her covered. I think I know a way to get her off Kilgrave's hit list. But it's gonna be painful. Jessica walks away. CUT TO: TRISH'S STUDIO Trish is about to go live. Jessica sits in the next room with Trish's assistant. ASSISTANT: And we're live in three, two... TRISH: Hi, I'm Trish walker, and this is Trish Talk. During my last broadcast, I made some... Flippant and disrespectful comments about a certain individual. I was out of line by belittling this man, and ignorant of my own limitations in challenging him. He is a very fascinating and powerful man, deserving of respect, and to that end, if he's listening, and I think he is... I want to apologize. I hope he forgives me. Jessica nods. Cut to them walking on the sidewalk outside. TRISH: I need a shower. JESSICA: Saying the words doesn't make it true. Remember acting? It's how you won that award. TRISH: My mom blew half the jury to get me that award. It might not have been about my acting. JESSICA: Fine, but Kilgrave knows you're afraid of him, and that's all he cares about. TRISH: Men and power, it's seriously a disease. (Jessica stops walking.). I mean, superpowered man, but... Trish notices that Jessica has stopped walking and stops too. TRISH: Jess? Jessica is looking at a man with a camera pointed at her, who is taking photos. Jessica quickly walks towards him, only to realize he's taking pictures of someone else. TRISH: Jess? Jess, are you okay? JESSICA: Yeah, I just thought I... Saw someone I knew. TRISH: Yeah, no Teen Choice Award for you. Talk. JESSICA: Kilgrave's been surveilling me. Taking pictures. TRISH: Why? JESSICA: I don't know. So he can record me imploding as he tortures me? The spy could be anyone, or everyone. It's been going on for weeks. I had no idea. TRISH: Just breathe, okay? He isn't here now. JESSICA: Yeah, well, he's always here. Jessica points her her head, then turns and begins walking again. Trish follows her. CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT Jessica sits at her computer, deleting pictures of Luke. JESSICA: (Narrating) I don't need reminders of what I did to Luke. Even if I had good intentions. Mostly. CUT TO: HOGARTH'S OFFICE Hogarth sits at her desk, talking to someone on speaker phone. HOGARTH: Listen to me, Larry. You are never gonna win this one. LARRY: Oh, are you a legislator now? Are you gonna rewrite the patent law? HOGARTH: I'm not going to have to. Do you have any idea how much people love their pets? Your clients poisoned their pets, abusing manufacturing loopholes in China. You know who people hate more than litigators? Jessica bursts into the room, followed by Pam. HOGARTH: Puppy killers. LARRY: We can come in at half. PAM: She won't wait. She wouldn't listen. JESSICA: I couldn't hear you over that print. HOGARTH: Larry, let me call you back. Hogarth hangs up. Pam leaves. HOGARTH: That was a potential fifty-million-dollar settlement. Now I have to ramp him back up. JESSICA: Oops. I need to know if your firm represents Audrey Eastman. She says she's with Desmond Tobey. HOGARTH: Well, then you should be invading Tobey's office. JESSICA: I did. Are 'attorney-client privilege' the only words that he knows? He wouldn't even tell me if he referred her to me. HOGARTH: What's going on? You're on edge. JESSICA: The last people referred to me wound up dead in my elevator. If Audrey Eastman follows the same path, she won't be able to pay her legal bills. HOGARTH: She is a client, I'll confirm that. JESSICA: And do you trust him? Tobey? HOGARTH: He's a partner. JESSICA: That's not an answer. HOGARTH: He's handling my own divorce, so yes, I trust him. JESSICA: Okay, good, that's all I need to know. HOGARTH: You need to pull yourself together. You are coming across distinctly paranoid. JESSICA: Everyone keeps saying that. It's like a conspiracy. Jessica leaves. CUT TO: ALLEYWAY Jessica is crouched high up in an alleyway, stalking Audrey. Her phone vibrates. She answers it. JESSICA: I'm working. TRISH: What if the apology didn't work? JESSICA: Then I'll deal with it. Look, I'm with a client right now. Sort of. TRISH: How can you trust any client after what happened with Hope's parents. JESSICA: I don't. Which is why I've been following her since dawn. TRISH: Following who? JESSICA: A jealous wife. TRISH: Jess, come on, I need the distraction. JESSICA: Fine. A jewelry designer. Audrey Eastman. TRISH: Overpriced, chunky, enamel stuff? Well, if she is mind-controlled, that would explain some of her jewelry. JESSICA: It's not like she needs the money. Her parents died and left her a fortune, but all she does is work. TRISH: Cheating husband. She's compartmentalizing. JESSICA: Useful skill. TRISH: How will you know if she's Kilgraved? JESSICA: His effect has limits. TRISH: Right. Time and distance. But you can't follow her forever. JESSICA: I've never seen his voodoo last longer than 10 hours, 12 tops. If he doesn't show soon, I'll... do the job and take pictures of the cheater with his pants around his ankles. Nothing plays like pictures. CUT TO: POLICE CAR Simpson sits in his police cruiser. His phone rings, and he answers it. SIMPSON: Yeah? JESSICA: You still wanna help catch Kilgrave? SIMPSON: Yes. JESSICA: It's a little illegal. SIMPSON: Answer's still yes. JESSICA: Can you get me a police surveillance video? SIMPSON: Who are you looking for? JESSICA: Myself. Kilgrave's got somebody tailing me, feeding him pictures. Police footage will show who's around me. SIMPSON: Yeah, well, we have cameras all over the city. You got times, dates, locations? JESSICA: Texting them to you now. SIMPSON: I got your six. They both hang up. Jessica scoffs. JESSICA: 'Got my six'. Jessica sees Audrey leaving and follows her. CUT TO: SIDEWALK OUTSIDE A RESTAURANT Hogarth and Pam are walking to a restaurant. PAM: It's an hour north of Rome. My sister said the views from the hotel are amazing. HOGARTH: Unbelievable. Two more walk-ins because of that goddamn radio interview. PAM: Can I have my Jeri back, please? I would love to have lunch without us bringing the office with us. HOGARTH: I'm sorry. I'm here. And I promise you, after this circus is over, I will take you anywhere you want to go. Okay? PAM: Okay. Inside, Wendy kisses a man and leaves. They meet outside. WENDY: Oh, come on. Don't tell me you're bringing her here. PAM: We have a reservation. HOGARTH: Wendy, you don't have exclusive rights to every restaurant we've ever been to. WENDY: Just the one where you proposed. PAM: You proposed to her here? Jesus, Jeri. WENDY: Did you forget? HOGARTH: I didn't forget proposing, no. WENDY: (To Pam) Well, that's worse for you than for me, because it means she's fine giving you leftover romance. PAM: Let's just go somewhere else. HOGARTH: No! WENDY: If she orders you the tiramisu and there is a diamond ring at the bottom, you'll think nothing could ever make you stop feeling happy. Don't choke on it. HOGARTH: You think, if you break us up, that I will crawl back to you? Read my face. Never gonna happen. Wendy walks away, tearing up. HOGARTH: She does not get this goddamn restaurant. PAM: Yeah, she does. Pam walks away. CUT TO: SIDEWALK IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY Jessica watches Audrey from behind a car. JESSICA: (Narrating) If Audrey Eastman is controlled by Kilgrave, it's going to wear off soon. He'll need to re-up. Audrey unlocks a shady, abandoned building, and goes inside. It looks to be an abandoned bar. She lays her things on the bar and turns on a speaker system. Loud rock music starts playing. She takes a gun out of her purse. Jessica jumps up onto a dumpster to get a better view inside of the building. She sees Audrey, with mufflers on, shooting. JESSICA: Shit. Jessica breaks the lock on the back door and sneaks in. Jessica gets the Sufentanil ready. Audrey has a number of female dummies set up to practice shooting. JESSICA: (Narrating) Thirteen hours and no Kilgrave, but... She's planning to use that on someone. Maybe the wandering penis? Jessica leaves as Audrey continues shooting. CUT TO: HOGARTH'S FIRM A number of people are in line at the lobby. PAM: Name, address, daytime phone, medical history, including any visits to a psychiatric facility. Next. Pam sees Jessica and gestures for her to go meet Hogarth. JESSICA: Your text said it was urgent. HOGARTH: It is. JESSICA: Yet there's no gun to your head. I don't like being summoned. HOGARTH: Quelle surprise. I have a job for you. JESSICA: Who are all these people? HOGARTH: They claim they were mind-controlled by Kilgrave. You should have seen the ones we turned away. JESSICA: Maybe some of them are legit. HOGARTH: Oh, please. The Trish Talk interview turned him into the most popular alibi in the city. JESSICA: You bought Dr. Kurata's kidney story, why not at least talk to them. HOGARTH: Because I don't have time for this right now. Because I have bigger problems, okay? Wendy has decided to make this divorce very difficult for me, and I need dirt on her. JESSICA: That's why you called me? I have a gun-toting client, a spy to find - HOGARTH: You owe me a favor. JESSICA: You were married to her. You already have dirt. HOGARTH: She didn't know mine. JESSICA: Well, you're sneaky. That doesn't mean she is. HOGARTH: I didn't say it would be easy. God. JESSICA: Fine. Later. Who's first? A number of heads in the room turn to look at Jessica. Cue a montage of Jessica and Hogarth filming interviews with potential victims of Kilgrave. JESSICA: Start at the beginning. MAN 1: I wen into 7-Eleven for a bag of doritos, you know? And then this Chinese dude comes in, and his eyes were all red and glowing, and I was like, 'Dude!' Hogarth rolls her eyes. MOTHER: My Lucy is a nice girl. A virgin. Tell them. Go ahead. A visibly pregnant teenager sits down. LUCY: Kilgrave made me do it. He's our gardener. Jessica listens incredulously. MAN 2: He landed on Jones Beach. I thought it was a meteor. But then, a man came out of the waves. Cut to a woman with bandages on her hands. WOMAN 1: He lived with me for two days. He made me play my cello for him, until I made a mistake. MAN 1: He didn't even talk, man! He just like, stared at me with his freaky glowing eyes. I was like, 'This dude is making me wanna jack this place.' I pulled out my gun... WOMAN 2: I couldn't stop smiling. He wouldn't let me. LUCY: He said, 'You want me bad'. And then I did want him. Bad. MOTHER: And not just Lucy. All the girls in the neighborhood. When he speaks, they spread their legs. Evil man. MAN 2: He gave me a purple staff, and made me slide it up my... Jessica's eyes widen. MAN 3: He had dreads. MAN 4: Bald. WOMAN 1: Dark hair. WOMAN 2: He wore a white dress shirt. WOMAN 1: Intense eyes. WOMAN 2: And a tie. MAN 1: A red T-shirt. I think. LUCY: He never wears a shirt. He's hot. MAN 5: I was waiting for the L train. And he said, uh, 'Nice jacket. You wanna give it to me, right?' And I said, 'Yeah'. And, like an asshole, I handed it over. Now, I know it's not the same as killing my parents, but... It was Zegna. That limey cocksucker owes me five grand. JESSICA: Limey? MAN 5: Yeah, he had an accent. He's British. JESSICA: Get up. MAN 5: I'm telling the truth! JESSICA: Get up. Jessica gets up and looks the man over. She imagines him as Kilgrave. JESSICA: Put him on the list. Cut to a conference room. Jessica addresses a group of people. JESSICA: Talk amongst yourselves. Exchange info. Thanks. Jessica leaves the room. HOGARTH: What was that about? JESSICA: We're starting a band. I told them to keep in touch. Talk. HOGARTH: You starting a support group? Will you be participating? JESSICA: Like I'd waste my time circle jerking with a bunch of whiners. Jessica begins walking away. HOGARTH: Yes, you are a paragon of mental health. Jessica comes back. JESSICA: I'm using them, Hogarth. I wanna know everything they did with him, everywhere they went, every word that was said, particularly about me, and what the hell he's gonna do next. HOGARTH: Kilgrave wanted a leather jacket, live cello music, and the flattering smile of a pretty girl. What a waste. He could solve so many problems with his gift. JESSICA: Gift? HOGARTH: I just meant if... If he was on our side. JESSICA: What side would that be? The side that uses people? Treats them like animals? HOGARTH: Jessica, do not take this out on me. JESSICA: Just to throw them away like they're garbage? The side that rips your life apart and destroys you from the inside out? Whose side exactly would that be? Jessica punches a nearby door, cracking the glass. She leaves. CUT TO: STREET AT NIGHT Jessica walks outside. After a few moments, Simpson approaches her. SIMPSON: Hey! Hey, I got your movie. It's thirty hours. Cast of thousands. He hands her a tape. She walks into a nearby building. JESSICA: Thanks. I should've got some popcorn. He follows her into the building. SIMPSON: Listen, there's a lot to comb through, but your spy is in there somewhere. Simpson sees Malcolm hiding in a corner of the lobby. SIMPSON: Hey! What are you looking at, huh? What the hell are you looking at, huh? He lifts Malcolm up against the wall. JESSICA: Hey, get off him! SIMPSON: He's watching! JESSICA: Yeah, he's probably watching the ceiling melt. MALCOLM: He doesn't like me. JESSICA: Malcolm, go sleep it off. Malcolm walks away. JESSICA: Hey, I got enough to deal with without worrying about you going all search and destroy on me. SIMPSON: I know, I am... I know how to turn it off, I... The paranoia and the panic, I just - JESSICA: Listen, there's this... Group of people. They've all been through the same thing, so... If you wanna talk or something, they meet tomorrow night. Simpson gives her a weird look. JESSICA: Yeah, I'm not into it either. SIMPSON: I gotta go. Simpson quickly leaves. Cut to Jessica watching the tape he gave her. She tries matching up a picture with the video, but the position of the photographer is just out of view. JESSICA: Goddamn it. She pulls up a picture of Luke. JESSICA: (Narrating) Now I know how it feels, someone watching your every move. Seeing you in private moments. She stands up, counts some money, grabs the Sufentanil, and leaves. Cut to her walking on the sidewalk. A little girl walks up onto the sidewalk. GIRL: Jessica. Are you Jessica? JESSICA: Yeah. Where are your parents? GIRL: Patsy Walker is safe. JESSICA: What did you say? GIRL: You don't have to worry about her, for now. JESSICA: Who told you that? GIRL: The man. He said he liked her apology. JESSICA: How old are you? GIRL: Eight and a half. JESSICA: I'm sorry that this is happening to you. GIRL: You're a bitch! You could have stopped that bus! You left him there to die in the street, like a goddamn dog. JESSICA: Stop it. GIRL: You turn everything to shit. JESSICA: Jesus. GIRL: It's Friday. JESSICA: What does that mean? GIRL: Don't you have a job to do? JESSICA: Are you talking about Audrey? Did Kilgrave send Audrey? Did he send Audrey? Was he at her target practice? Jessica grabs the little girl by the arm. The girl screams. GIRL: Mommy! Where's mommy? JESSICA: It's okay, I'm going to help you find your mom! WOMAN: Chanise! GIRL: Mommy! She won't let me go! JESSICA: Sorry! I'm sorry. WOMAN: Are you okay? Did she hurt you baby? JESSICA: She was lost, I was just trying to help. WOMAN: Stay away from her! CUT TO: TRISH'S APARTMENT The doorbell rings. Trish sees Simpson outside. TRISH: What are you doing here? SIMPSON: I'm sorry to show up like this. I just wanted to make this right. TRISH: You can't. SIMPSON: I got something for you. TRISH: I don't want anything from you. SIMPSON: Well, it might help. Please. Um... It's personal. TRISH: I can't let you in. Put it on the floor. He puts the box on the floor outside the door. TRISH: Now go to the end of the hall. Simpson walks to the end of the hall. Trish opens the door and quickly grabs the box, closing the door again. She opens it, revealing a gun. SIMPSON: Did you open it? TRISH: Yes. SIMPSON: I just want you to feel safe. TRISH: Is it legal? SIMPSON: No. You still there? On the other side of the door, Trish holds the gun to where Simpson's head is. CUT TO: SIDEWALK Jessica follows Carlo as he carries some flowers on the sidewalk. JESSICA: (Narrating) Audrey was right about her husband. Carlo's clearly not in a hurry to get home. Cases like this remind me of why I'm single. Eventually, Carlo reaches a building and enters. JESSICA: (Narrating). I could storm the gates and get the money shot... But not if Kilgrave got to Audrey somehow. Jessica jumps onto a balcony. Inside, she sees Carlo enter a room. JESSICA: Shit. She opens a window and sneaks in. She sees Carlo and a woman having sex. Jessica's phone begins to vibrate. She answers it. JESSICA: Hello? AUDREY: Hi, it's Audrey Eastman. JESSICA: Yeah, I know. AUDREY: Did you follow him? JESSICA: Wait, what? AUDREY: Where are you? Jessica? Hello? Jessica? Are you there? Jessica moves her phone away from her ear and realizes Audrey is in the room with Carlo. AUDREY: Jessica? Can you hear me? Where - where is Carlo? Jessica throws the doors open. JESSICA: He's three feet to your right, asshole. Audrey stands up and trains her gun on Jessica. Carlo also stands up. AUDREY: Get her on the plastic. CARLO: How? AUDREY: I have a gun on her for Christ's sake Carlo. JESSICA: You shoot at me, I'll pull the bullet out of my ruined jacket and shove it up your ass with my pinky finger, and who do you think that's gonna hurt more? CARLO: You're bulletproof? Audrey shoots her in the arm. Jessica yelps. CARLO: Jesus! AUDREY: Nope, not bulletproof. CARLO: Audrey, this is insane. Honey, we don't have to do this. We can walk out of here right now. AUDREY: She doesn't have laser eyes either, or she would have used them. JESSICA: Laser eyes? Who said I had laser eyes? Oh, that dick with the Aston Martin. I served him a subpoena. AUDREY: Gregory Spheeris. I sell to his wife. They're very talky. JESSICA: Look, you're obviously pissed off about something, but I'm pretty sure, for the first time, this has nothing to do with Kilgrave. He's smarter than you two. AUDREY: Kilgrave? Who's Kilgrave? Is he another one of you people? How many more are there like you? JESSICA: How many more what, private eyes? AUDREY: Gifted. Stupid word. It's like calling someone special. They're not special, they're retarded. You're not gifted, you're a freak. JESSICA: What have we or the mentally challenged ever done to you? AUDREY: You saved the city. That's what the newspapers said. You were 'heroes'. JESSICA: Not me. AUDREY: The city was saved. But I was there. I saw what really happened. I saw my mother crushed to death under a building that you people destroyed. JESSICA: In the incident? AUDREY: I was trying to pull my mother out from the rubble, watching her bleed to death, while all around me you people were raining down hell. JESSICA: So go after the big green guy, or the flag waver! I wasn't even there! AUDREY: Consider it a preventative measure for next time! Jessica pulls a tarp out from under her, causing the gun to go flying. JESSICA: You think you're the only ones who've lost people? Carlo goes for the gun, but Jessica grabs it and throws it into a wall. She begins tearing the room apart. JESSICA: You think you're the only ones with pain? You think you can take your shit and dump it on me? You don't get to do that! So you take your goddamn pain and you live with it, assholes! You lost your parents? Welcome to the goddamn club! I lost mine in some random accident. Do you see me trying to kill every shitty driver? No! Because I don't work my shit out on other people! So keep your goddamn feelings to yourselves! Ninety-nine. You wanted to know how many of us there are? The last time I counted, I had 99 gifted friends in this borough alone. And now every single one of them is gonna know about this shit that you tried to pull. And they hate attempted murder. They really do. The cops hate it too, you know, because it's against the law. CARLO: Please don't kill us. We're gonna leave you alone. JESSICA: There's only one thing that you can do to save yourselves. AUDREY: What? JESSICA: Disappear. Nobody, especially me, ever hears from you again. Me and my friends will stop by tomorrow to make sure you heard me. Jessica leaves. CARLO: I want a divorce. CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT Jessica is taking a shower. She looks at where the bullet hit her, and watches blood go down the drain. Cut to her at her desk, looking at the files of people she interviewed. She watches a clip from one of the interviews, then closes her computer and leaves. CUT TO: TRISH'S APARTMENT Trish and Simpson sit on opposite sides of the door. TRISH: And this one guy stitched a silhouette of my hair in orange sequins. And this girl sent me a stuffed, uh... It kind of looked like a voodoo doll. SIMPSON: Of you? TRISH: Me or Carrot Top. It wasn't clear. SIMPSON: It's creepy. TRISH: Well, it seemed normal at the time. My mother had been marketing the Patsy dolls for years, so, uh... The whole thing's a little embarrassing now. SIMPSON: I had G.I. Joes, till they all burned. TRISH: Burned? SIMPSON: They went into battle to save my sister's Barbie, and melted into one big clump. TRISH: That's terrible. SIMPSON: Hey, the accomplished their mission. TRISH: By dying? SIMPSON: They rescued Barbie. I mean, the Dream House was gutted, but she had insurance. TRISH: You used actual fire? You torched a Dream House? SIMPSON: I was committed to the scenario. They both laugh. SIMPSON: That was meant to be a story about how I've always been the guy saving people. TRISH: Albeit plastic people, and they melted. SIMPSON: Well, I just need you to know that. The guy who tried to kill you, it wasn't me. TRISH: I don't blame you. SIMPSON: Well, you're doing better than me. I tried to fight it. I couldn't. TRISH: Hey, listen. What Kilgrave did to you, he did to Jessica. It doesn't matter how strong you are. SIMPSON: Maybe not, but we can protect ourselves. Trish plays with the gun in her hands. SIMPSON: Trish? Trish opens the door. Simpson stands up. TRISH: I might shoot you by accident. SIMPSON: It's worth the risk. Simpson enters her apartment. CUT TO: SIDEWALK Jessica walks outside. She watches various people walk past her. She holds her arms out and spins around. CUT TO: TRISH'S APARTMENT Trish and Simpson sit and drink coffee. SIMPSON: You went back to work? TRISH: I had to. I needed things to feel normal again. SIMPSON: Yeah, so did I. TRISH: Ah, you're a New York City cop. I'm sure your normal is pretty crazy to begin with. As the camera pans down, we see that Trish is still holding the gun. SIMPSON: Unlike being an actress. TRISH: Completely sane profession. SIMPSON: Yeah. CUT TO: SIDEWALK Jessica is walking on the sidewalk. Her phone vibrates and she answers it. JESSICA: Hogarth. HOGARTH: I sent more potential victims to your survivor's group. JESSICA: It's not my survivor's group. HOGARTH: Maybe it should be. You need to process your trauma. JESSICA: I'm sorry, who is this? HOGARTH: Fine. You need to not take your crap out on my glass walls. JESSICA: Put it on my tab. HOGARTH: When are you planning to pay that off? JESSICA: Not tonight, Hogarth. Not tonight. She hangs up on Hogarth and enters a restaurant where the survivor's group is meeting. Cut to Jessica listening in on the group. MAN: Avery was crying because I forgot to put his action figures in the car. He'd been fussy all morning, and in the car, he was just impossible. I lost my temper. Then we hit a red light just south of Herald Square, and Kilgrave just opened the door and got in. Said he liked my car, wanted to ride around. Avery was still crying, but Kilgrave never once looked at him. He just stared straight ahead and said, 'You'd like to leave your son, wouldn't you?' And I said yes. I pulled Avery out, put him on the curb, and drove away. I saw him in my rear-view mirror, just weeping on the sidewalk, and I hated myself because... it's what I wanted. I disappeared for a week while I was Kilgrave's chauffeur. Jessica looks up. MAN: I was charged with child abandonment. My wife left me, which, I don't blame her, because - JESSICA: You drove him for a week? 24/7? MAN: Yes, it was a nightmare. I was haunted by - JESSICA: Where did you drive him? WOMAN 1: I'm not sure that's the - JESSICA: Did he meet anyone in particular? Did anyone deliver pictures to him? MAN: Um, actually, yeah. JESSICA: Who? MAN: I don't know, I just had to drive Kilgrave to meet the same guy every day at 10:00 a.m. on the dot. He was very punctual. JESSICA: What did he look like? WOMAN 2: Is this some kind of reenactment therapy? JESSICA: Screw therapy. What did he look like, the guy he met? MAN: Well, I never got close, and it was freezing. Everyone's wrapped in tons of layers and hats. He wore a scarf. Blue and white stripes. Jessica leaves the restaurant. Cut to her back in her apartment. She looks through the security camera footage, trying to find someone like the man described. She eventually pauses the video, spotting the person. She realizes that it's Malcolm. She breaks into his apartment, revealing a printer with some photos of her. In his apartment, she sees a picture of him with his mom. She starts tearing up. END EPISODE"

Changes - Greatest Hits Version,2Pac,176962797,"I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself? I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero 'Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare!' First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other 'It's time to fight back,' that's what Huey said Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead I got love for my brother But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start makin' changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And that's how it's supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids But things change and that's the way it is  That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  I see no changes, all I see is racist faces Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races We under, I wonder what it takes to make this One better place, let's erase the wasted Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight And the only time we chill is when we kill each other It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other And although it seems heaven-sent We ain't ready to see a black president It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks But some things will never change Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game Now tell me, what's a mother to do? Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way 'I made a G today,' but you made it in a sleazy way Sellin' crack to the kids 'I gotta get paid!'  well hey, but that's the way it is  That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  We gotta make a change It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes Let's change the way we eat Let's change the way we live And let's change the way we treat each other You see the old way wasn't workin' So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive  And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace? It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin' back after all these years 'Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,' that's the way it is  That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah (You're my brother, you're my sister) That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  Some things'll never change"

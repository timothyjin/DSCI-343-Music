Rx (Medicate),Theory of a Deadman,98690247,"Wake up to a cloudy day Dark rolls in, and it starts to rain Staring out to the cage-like walls Time goes by and the shadows crawl Crushing candy, crushing pills Got no job, mom pays my bills Texting exes, get my fill Sweating bullets, Netflix chills World's out there singing the blues Twenty more dead on the evening news Think to myself: 'Really, what's the use?' I'm just like you, I was born to lose  Why, oh, why can't you just fix me? When all I want's to feel numb But the medication's all gone Why, oh, why does God hate me? When all I want's to get high And forget this so-called life  I am so frickin' bored Nothing to do today I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate) I am so frickin' bored Nothing to do today I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)  Can't wait to feel better than I ever will Attack that shit like a kid on Benadryl Chase it down with a hopeful smile Hate myself, I can go for miles They say family's all you need Someone to trust who can help you breathe Inhale that drug, but you start to choke You fall on the outs of an inside joke  Why, oh, why can't you just fix me? When all I want's to feel numb But the medication's all gone Why, oh, why does God hate me? Cause I've seen enough of it, heard enough of it, felt enough of it Had enough of it!  I am so frickin' bored Nothing to do today I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate) I am so frickin' bored Nothing to do today I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)  Superman is a hero But only when his mind is clear, though He needs that fix like the rest of us So he's got no fear when he saves that bus All the stars in the Hollywood Hills Snapchat live while they pop them pills All those flavors of the rainbow Too bad that shit don't work though  Your friends are high right now Your parents are high right now That hot chick's high right now That cop is high right now The president's high right now Your priest is high right now Everyone's high as fuck right now And no one's ever coming down!  I am so frickin' bored Nothing to do today I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate) I am so frickin' bored Nothing to do today I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)  Medicate"

Prayers,Good Charlotte,4228410,"Born on a lonely planet full of broken dreams Where no one understands me When I finally met an angel, I didn't know what to say She just held my hand And we would lay awake at night, looking at the stars Thinking of the ones we've lost, and wonder where they are When we lit another candle, she asked me who's to blame Then she put her arms around me and held me to the flame  So why do we hurt each other? We don't need the words for one another's  Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all Do they answer when you call? These prayers, when you don't mean what you say Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate  None of this makes sense in this reality God just leaves the room when I turn on my TV I see a little girl who's crying 'cause she lost her family All these strangers sending thoughts and prayers, she's buried underneath  Why do we kill each other? We can't feel the pain in one another's  Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all Do they answer when you call? These prayers, when you don't mean what you say Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate  We're so far away from one another We keep building walls between each other's  Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all Do they answer when you call? These prayers, when you don't mean what you say Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate  Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all Do they answer when you call?

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses  Well I'm so far away That each step that I take is on my way home A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night Just to see through this payphone Still I run out of time Or it's hard to get through Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you I'll just close my eyes and whisper Baby blind love is true  I want to lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh I want to be just as close as The Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses  The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry The barkeeper's wig's crooked And she's giving me the eye I might have said yeah But I laughed so hard I think I died   Now as you close your eyes Know I'll be thinking about you While my mistress she calls me To stand in her spotlight again Tonight I won't be alone But you know that don't Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove For it's you that I'd die to defend  I want to lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses I want to lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses

Sea Change,Thrice,5959504,"We scoff and roll our eyes Yeah, we've heard this all before in a different guise These shrill alarmist fears We don't deign to entertain them, covering our ears  So where will we go when the waters threaten to wash us away? And all of our sons and our daughters wilt in the heat of the day? I feel the sun draw nearer, I feel the sea start to rise Who's looking back in the mirror? Why are they closing - Why are they closing their eyes?  Now that heavy curtain sways And the man who stands behind tries to give his name So we ask ourselves, 'Who stands to gain?' Soon our tired talking points are feeling awfully strained  So where will we go when the waters threaten to wash us away? And all of our sons and our daughters wilt in the heat of the day? I feel the sun draw nearer, I feel the sea start to rise Who's looking back in the mirror? Why are they closing - Why are they closing their eyes?  So where will we go when the waters threaten to wash us away? And all of our sons and our daughters wilt in the heat of the day? I feel the sun draw nearer, I feel the sea start to rise Who's looking back in the mirror? Why are they closing - Why are they closing their eyes?  Why are we closing, why are we closing our eyes? Why are we closing, why are we closing our eyes? Why are we closing, why are we closing our eyes? Why are we closing, why are we closing our eyes?"

You make a fool of death with your beauty And for a moment  I thought that love was in the drugs But the more I took, the more it took away And I could never get enough I thought that love was on the stage, give yourself to strangers You don't have to be afraid Then it tries to find a home With people or when I'm alone Picking it apart And staring at your phone  We all have a hunger We all have a hunger We all have a hunger We all have a hunger  Tell me what you need Oh, you look so free The way you use your body, baby Come on and work it for me Don't let them get you down You're the best thing I've seen We never found the answer But we knew one thing  We all have a hunger (We all have a hunger) We all have a hunger (We all have a hunger) We all have a hunger (We all have a hunger) We all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)  And it's Friday night and it's kicking in In that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me Oh and you in all your vibrant youth How could anything bad ever happen to you?

The Spirit Of Radio,Rush,34008951,"Begin the day with a friendly voice A companion unobtrusive Plays that song that's so elusive And the magic music makes your morning mood  Off on your way, hit the open road There is magic at your fingers For the spirit ever lingers Undemanding contact in your happy solitude  Invisible airwaves crackle with life Bright antenna bristle with the energy Emotional feedback on timeless wavelength Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free  All this machinery making modern music Can still be open-hearted Not so coldly charted It's really just a question of your honesty Yeah, your honesty One likes to believe in the freedom of music But glittering prizes And endless compromises Shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah  Invisible airwaves crackle with life Bright antenna bristle with the energy Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free   For the words of the prophets Were written on the studio wall Concert hall And echoes with the sound Of salesmen Of salesmen Of salesmen!"

Piano Man,Billy Joel,314062672,"It's nine o'clock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in There's an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin He says, 'Son, can you play me a memory? I'm not really sure how it goes But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete When I wore a younger man's clothes.'  La la la, di da da La la, di da da da dum  Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright  Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke But there's someplace that he'd rather be He says, 'Bill, I believe this is killing me.' As the smile ran away from his face 'Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star If I could get out of this place'  La la la, di da da La la, di da da da dum  Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy And probably will be for life And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness But it's better than drinkin' alone  Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright  It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see To forget about life for a while And the piano, it sounds like a carnival And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar And say, 'Man, what are you doin' here?'  La la la, di da da La la, di da da da dum  Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright"

Carry on, you will always remember Carry on, nothing equals the splendor Now your life's no longer empty But surely heaven waits for you  Carry on my wayward son There'll be peace when you are done Lay your weary head to rest Don't you cry Don't you cry no more  No more!"

American Pie,Don McLean,230842294,"A long, long time ago... I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And, maybe, theyd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper Id deliver Bad news on the doorstep; I couldnt take one more step I cant remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died  So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, 'Thisll be the day that I die 'Thisll be the day that I die.'  Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Do you believe in rock n' roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that youre in love with him `Cause I saw you dancin in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singing  Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, 'Thisll be the day that I die 'Thisll be the day that I die.'  Now for ten years weve been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin stone But thats not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned; No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singing  Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, 'Thisll be the day that I die 'Thisll be the day that I die.'  Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance! `Cause the players tried to take the field; The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singing  Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, 'Thisll be the day that I die 'Thisll be the day that I die.'  Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick! Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devils only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satans spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died We were singing  Bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, 'Thisll be the day that I die 'Thisll be the day that I die.'  I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where Id heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldnt play And in the streets: the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken; The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most: The father, son, and the holy ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing  And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised him everything I could give If only he would make the music live And he promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn  Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, 'Thisll be the day that I die 'Thisll be the day that I die.' They were singing Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, 'Thisll be the day that I die'"

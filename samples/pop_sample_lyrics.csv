All of the Stars,Ed Sheeran,180645264,"It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon I saw a shooting star and thought of you I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew If you were here, I'd sing to you You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two I'm miles away from seeing you But I can see the stars from America I wondered, do you see them too?  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  I can hear your heart on the radio beat They're playing 'Chasing Cars' and I thought of us Back to the time you were lying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew Everything led back to you So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? You're the song my heart is beating to  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  And oh, I know And oh, I know And oh I can see the stars From America"

I See Fire - From 'The Hobbit - The Desolation Of Smaug',Ed Sheeran,652570894,"Oh misty eye of the mountain below Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke Keep watching over Durin's sons  If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together Watch the flames climb high into the night Calling out father oh, stand by and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side  And if we should die tonight, we should all die together Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out father oh, prepare as we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky  Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me  Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky  Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me  And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes For if the dark returns then my brothers will die And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out  Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin) I see fire And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside"

From Time,Drake,210052052,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...  I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love  Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the 70's on your own My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?

Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?

How Far I'll Go - From 'Moana',Alessia Cara,489216922,"I've been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember, never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try  Every turn I take, every trail I track Every path I make, every road leads back To the place I know, where I cannot go Where I long to be  See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me And no one knows how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go  Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  I know everybody on this island seems so happy On this island, everything is by design I know everybody on this island has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with mine  I can lead with pride, I can make us strong I'll be satisfied if I play along But the voice inside sings a different song What is wrong with me?  See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding But no one knows, how deep it goes And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line? See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me And no one knows, how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know, how far I'll go"

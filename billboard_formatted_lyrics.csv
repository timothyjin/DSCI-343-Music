wonders whether assad's regime executed worst chemical weapons attack st century -- fact think beyond question -- world wonders whether united states america consent silence standing aside kind brutality allowed happen without consequence. nearly years since first global commitment chemical weapons, two tyrants dared cross world's brightest (line ?). bashar al-assad become third, think know history holds nothing infamy criminals, history reserves also little sympathy enablers. reality gravity moment. importance decision congress faces world waiting learn next days. now, ranking member corker asked central question: americans care, beyond said, ought enough judgment president administration? well, clear addition mentioned syria accountability act threat middle east, cannot overlook impact chemical weapons danger pose particular volatile area world we've deeply invested years great friends there. allies there. deep interests there. since president obama's policy assad must go, insignificant deprive capacity use chemical weapons, degrade capacity use chemical weapons, actually deprives lethal weapon ongoing civil war, impact. help stabilize region, ultimately. addition, important strategic national security interests, prevention proliferation chemical weapons avoid creation safe syria base operations extremists use weapons friends. us know extremes sides waiting wings, working pushing fighting. they'd desperate get hands materials. fact nothing happens begin change equation current calculation, area become even area ungoverned space extremists threaten even united states, immediately, get hands weapons, allies friends ours, like jordan, israel, lebanon others. forcing assad change calculation ability act impunity contribute realization cannot gas shoot way predicament. think know, president's primary goal achieve negotiated resolution. got parties prepared negotiate achieve that. syria also important because, quite simply -- can't put plainly ask ask rselves: assad, one despots region, united states steps back moment, together allies friends, message? message granted impunity -- freedom choose use weapons force us go cycle knows outcome refusing it. would granted capacity use weapons people greater levels damage, would stood stepped away. confidently know happened damascus, friends, august st, know assad would read stepping away silence invitation use weapons impunity. creating impunity, would creating opportunity -- opportunity dictators and/or terrorists pursue weapons mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. tell , people hoping united states congress vote limited request president put . iran hoping look way. inaction would surely give permission slip least misinterpret intention put test. hezbollah hoping isolationism prevail. north korea hoping ambivalence carries day. listening silence. answer assad today, erode standard existed hundred years. fact, erode standard protected troops war, invite even dangerous tests road. allies partners also counting us situation. people israel, jordan, turkey, look next door, see they're one stiff breeze away potential hurt, civilians killed consequences choices assad might take absence action. anxiously await assurance word means something. await assurance children lined unbloodied burial shrouds children would keep world's promise. that's they're hoping. authorization president obama seeks definitively national security interest. need send syria world, dictators terrorists, allies civilians alike unmistakable message united states america world say, never again, mean sometimes; mean somewhere; never means never. vote accountability. norms laws keep civilized world civil mean nothing they're enforced. justice jackson said opening argument nuremburg trials, ultimate step avoiding periodic wars, inevitable system international lawlessness, make statesmen responsible law. world's worst despots see flout impunity prohibitions world's worst weapons, prohibitions pieces paper. mean accountability mean cannot silent. let clear: president obama asking america go war. say sitting next two men -- secretary hagel chairman dempsey -- know war is. senator mccain knows war is. know difference going war president obama requesting now. agree, american boots ground. president made crystal clear, intention assuming responsibility syria's civil war. asking power make clear, make certain united states means say, world, join together multilateral statement, mean say. he's asking authorization degrade deter bashar al-assad's capacity use chemical weapons. now, undoubtedly ask, think appropriately, unintended consequences action? fear retaliation leads larger conflict. well, let put bluntly: assad arrogant enough, would say foolish enough, retaliate consequences criminal activity, united states allies ample ways make regret decision without going war. even assad's supporters, russia iran, say publicly use chemical weapons unacceptable. now, also question extent responsibility; them, say someone kills hundreds children weapon world banned, responsible. true treaties like geneva convention chemical weapons convention us, syria accountability act. also true share common humanity common decency. time armchair isolationism. time spectators slaughter. neither country conscience could afford cost silence. spoken unspeakable horror many times past; now, must stand act. must protect security, protect values lead world conviction clear responsibility. thank . sen. menendez: thank , mr. secretary -- audience member: secretary -- (off mic) -- people today -- (off mic) -- sen. menendez: (sounds gavel.) committee order. audience member: -- people said -- (off mic) -- go war. sen. menendez: committee order. audience member: want another war. sen. menendez: could ask police restore order? audience member: (off mic) -- nobody wants (war ?) -- (inaudible) -- war. american people want this. secretary -- (off mic) -- sen. menendez: secretary hagel. sec. kerry: say, -- (inaudible) -- know first time testified committee, years old, feelings similar protester. would say exactly important debate, talking things country congress act representing american people. think respect different point view, do. sen. menendez: secretary hagel. secretary charles hagel: mr. chairman, thank . chairman menendez ranking member corker, members committee, know, coming days congress debate respond recent chemical weapons attack syria, large-scale sarin gas assault perpetrated syrian government people. former senator member committee, welcome debate, strongly support president obama's decision seek congressional authorization use force syria. us knows, committing country using military force difficult decision america's leaders make, ranking member corker noted. privileged serve nation responsibility ask tough questions commitment made. american people must assured leaders acting according u.s. national interests, well- defined military objectives, understanding risks consequences involved. president, along entire national security team, asked tough questions concluded united states take military action syria assad regime done. want address reached decision clarifying u.s. interests stake, military objectives, risks acting critical juncture. president obama said, use chemical weapons syria assault humanity, serious threat america's national security interests closest allies. syrian regime's use chemical weapons poses grave risks friends partners along syria's borders, including israel, jordan, turkey, lebanon iraq. assad prepared use chemical weapons people, concerned terrorist groups like hezbollah, forces syria supporting assad regime, would acquire would use them. risk chemical weapons proliferation poses direct threat friends, partners u.s. personnel region. cannot afford hezbollah terrorist group determined strike united states incentives acquire use chemical weapons. syrian regime's actions risk eroding nearly century-old international norm use chemical weapons, secretary kerry noted, norm helped protect -- helped protect united states homeland american forces operating across globe terrible weapons. weakening norm would embolden regimes acquire use chemical weapons. example, north korea maintains massive stockpile chemical weapons threatens treaty ally republic korea , u.s. troops stationed there. i've returned asia, serious long conversation south korea's defense minister threat, real threat north korea's stockpile chemical weapons presents them. allies throughout world must assured united states fulfill security commitments. given threats national security, united states must demonstrate actions use chemical weapons unacceptable. president made clear military objectives syria would hold assad regime accountable, degrade ability carry kinds attacks, deter regime use chemical weapons. department defense developed military options achieve objectives. positioned u.s. assets throughout region successfully execute mission. believe achieve military action would limited duration scope. general dempsey assured president u.s. forces ready act whenever president gives order. also working allies partners effort. key partners, including france, turkey, saudi arabia, united arab emirates, friends region assured us strong support u.s. action. defining military objectives, made clear seeking resolve underlying conflict syria direct military force. instead contemplating actions tailored respond use chemical weapons. political solution created syrian people way ultimately end violence syria. secretary kerry leading international efforts help parties syria move toward negotiated transition, transition means free inclusive syria. we're also committed assist syrian opposition. assad must held accountable using weapons defiance international community. defined america's interests military objectives, also must examine risks consequences action well consequences inaction. always risks taking action. assad regime increasing pressure syrian opposition could feel empowered carry even devastating chemical weapons attacks without response. chemical weapons make distinction combatants innocent civilians inflict worst kind indiscriminate suffering recently seen. refusal act would undermine credibility america's security commitments, including president's commitment prevent iran acquiring nuclear weapon. word united states must mean something. vital currency foreign relations international allied commitments. every witness today -- secretary kerry, general dempsey -- served uniform, fought war seen ugly realities close -- already noted, senator mccain. understand country faces decisions grave

threatening dangerous potentially ultimately cost lives. sen. menendez: consider consequences inaction greater consequences action? sec. kerry: do. sen. menendez: general dempsey, envision, broad terms, potential military campaign terms effect? expect end authorized action see results look like? expectation? gen. dempsey: yes, thank , chairman. task i've given develop military options deter --

classified setting. sen. menendez: understand that. let ask this: process achieving two goals outlined, would collateral consequence regime degrading overall capabilities? gen. dempsey: yes. sen. menendez: mr. secretary, received administration proposed resolution authorization force, course negotiation congress administration. would tell us whether believe prohibition american boots ground -- something administration would accept part resolution? sec. kerry: mr. chairman, would preferable to, intention plan desire whatsoever boots ground. think president give every assurance world, i, secretary defense chairman. event syria imploded, instance, event threat chemical weapons cache falling hands al-nusra someone else clearly interest allies us, british, french others, prevent weapons mass destruction falling hands worst elements, want take table option might might available president united states secure country. kind example, that's thing think would immediately leap mind say,

respect convention signed place since horrors world war i. truth world war ii, vietnam, korea, gulf wars, afghanistan, iraq, combatants efforts never resorted use. think clear, two prior usages referred to, would opening pandora's box respect whole set dangerous consequences result united states keeping word. would make life very, difficult respect north korea iran. there's question mind countries watching. mullahs many others watching great interest. that's even quality debate nature debate important. sen. menendez: thank . senator corker. sen. corker: thank , mr. chairman. again,

asking way takes away stated strategy empowering vetted opposition capacity time join transition government, stated beginning? anything authorization way supplements that? gen. dempsey: question opposition, moderate opposition, path resolution syrian conflict developed, capable, moderate opposition. know that. secondly, there's nothing resolution would limit we're now, we're focused response

sec. hagel: senator, are. noted opening statement, taken great care much time looking -- options present president, contingencies may consequence president selecting one options, including noted. imperfect; said -- think everyone recognizes -- always risk. we've tried minimize risk every way -- every presentation we've made president. president insisted -- collateral damage across board. yes, we've taken lot time focus exactly point. sen. cardin: secretary kerry, point act, we're liable lose friends. really want point out, direct interest here. humanitarian reason respond use chemical weapons, direct american interest region, americans region risk additional chemicals used. see direct connection u.s. interests. say may lose friends act. participation u.s. military response addition support? seems appears -- understand america lead, seem like growing list countries actively joining us military operation. sec. kerry: well, first all, definitive list point time president made decision specifically set choices he's going operate on. secondly, many countries could conceivably need able helpful limited operation volunteered helpful. stand ready take part specific operation. we're very, comfortable that. bottom line many ways remains we're talking specific kinds capacities that, cases, united states america possesses. know, remains open. process evolve debates evolves president makes decisions joint chiefs staff military present various options. probably evolve, mentioned. people may make adjustments syria. assure syrians general dempsey people making adjustments go along. sen. cardin: well, would hope would stronger international participation. consideration role nato play considering one nato's partners, turkey, direct front line use chemical weapons? -- considered? sec. kerry: well, say, considered -- everything considered, things evaluated. discussions taking place. meeting saturday vilnius european ministers. know topic come up. -- they're members nato, -- are, them. we'll discussions we're there. -- moment, limited operation, scope support president makes judgment ought have. broad -- already broad -- think we've -- i've -- know, we've nations countries organizations acknowledged chemical weapons used condemned publicly. thirty-one nations stated publicly assad regime responsible, think we're countries indicated allegations true would support form action syria. there's broad coalition that's growing people believe ought take action syria, question is, know, whether makes sense whatever number part decision military president make go along here. sen. cardin: i'll reserve rest questions closed session. thank . sen. menendez: senator rubio. audience member: (off mic.) sen. menendez: (sounds gavel.) gentleman sit down, i'll officer remove . (sounds gavel.) police make sure committee order. audience member: (off mic.) sec. kerry: yeah, that's said -- (off mic) -- sen. menendez: senator rubio. senator marco rubio (r-fl): thank , mr. chairman. let begin answering fundamental question get asked lot discuss important issue, is, even care what's happening syria? want clear belief think reflects belief members committee. happens syria -- vital national interest united states national security reasons already outlined. syrian relationship iran significant, key part ambitions regional power, dominant regional power. fact, iranians love brag syria gives border israel. number two, assad anti-american supporter terrorism, supporter hamas, he's supporter hezbollah. way, he's supporter al-qaida iraq, al-qaida iraq that's responsible death maiming countless brave ng men women served country uniform. also interest us instability creating syria, instability that's allowing portions syria quickly become kind afghanistan /, premier operational space global jihadists abroad come train fight plan attacks future. added chemical attack undermines -- post-world war ii world order, basically said things unacceptable. allies look united states capabilities living security promises risk result this. syria what's happening syria matters national interests, clearly tied critical national security interest united states. way, true two years ago, joined voices committee senate beyond advocated time, assad ropes, united states engage trying identify moderate elements equip became predominant rebel force syria others. happen. instead, choice made lead behind. choice made watch thing unfolded, others advocated mind business. we're seeing proof example america ignores problems, problems ignore us; ignore eventually grow come visit us doorstep. we're faced have. fact, -- secretary kerry, moment ago, said one calculations assad used deciding use chemical weapons u.s. anything it. understand, perhaps, made calculation because, yes, horrible incident thousand people died. incident, hundred thousand people died, including snipers used pick civilians, including women raped part -- going villages carried out. nothing happened. course reached calculation. reminder happens ignore world, look inwards sometimes ignore problems: get worse difficult solve. that's mess right now. left options, less ideal. want walk three presented us different voices ask specifically one president considering. first option decide help syrians remove assad replace (with ?) -- moderate government. think that's ideal outcome, complications. today rebel forces ground moderate rebels, they're nonmoderate rebels. they're jihadists control major portions country, parts country intermingled rebels forces, creating real prospect fall assad, new civil war could triggered -- one could involve sectarian violence, massacres minorities, et cetera. (as said ?), comes set complications. other, voices advocated, nothing. would guarantee following outcome: emboldened assad, emboldened iran, increased instability country portions country still ungoverned. also send message world red line fear crossing. iran move forward toward nuclear weapons. north korea act crazier, that's even possible. allies south korea japan may start doubt security arrangements us. israel may decide needs strike iran unilaterally. iran move towards bomb, which, way, iranian bomb. it'll turkish bomb well saudi bomb maybe even egyptian bomb one day. third action president asking us consider, termed, me, called shot across bow -- military strike limited duration scope three goals, understand it, outlined today. goal number one hold assad accountable. goal number two deter behavior future. goal number three degrade assad's capacity carry attacks future. -- president wants us authorize limited strike would accomplish three things. question have, quite frankly,  bit skeptical act -- president asking provide support needed achieve objectives, objectives even realistic point. here's first question, think i'll ask general dempsey. calculation assad made reason he's using chemical weapons he's afraid could lose war, overthrown killed. that's calculation he's made. that's used chemical weapons. wants beat rebels. question this: -- structure attack tips calculation he'll basically decide would rather risk overrun rebels risking limited attack u.s. uses chemical weapons. decide: i'll use chemical weapons take limited u.s. attack future i'll risk overrun rebels. going unbalance lead calculate he's better risking losing rebels? gen. dempsey: well, senator, think -- may even insidious that. he's reached point thinks chemical weapons another weapon arsenal. that's part makes dangerous. think i've provided advice targets may appropriate, certainly want degrade capabilities coming this. want come stronger go it. sen. rubio: leads second question: confident confident express committee fact put place military plan that's limited scope duration, effectively degrade assad's capability carry future chemical attacks? gen. dempsey:  confident capabilities bring bear deter degrade. surprise know initial target set subsequent target sets become necessary. sen. rubio: question probably secretary kerry, think asked earlier, think important elaborate it. one concerns i've heard others express assad could take three, five, six days strikes, maybe longer, maybe shorter, emerge saying, faced united states held onto power survived, point emboldened domestically perhaps even abroad. taken account? understand argument inaction would worse, taken account implications could assad could weather limited strike could mean long- term prospects conflict? sec. kerry: yes, absolutely have. certain, we've taken account. -- mean, weather. president's -- president's asking limited authority degrade current capacity deter using again. asking permission congress go destroy entire regime to, know, much extensive kind thing. that's he's asking. able stand up, doubt he'll try claim somehow is, know, something positive him. think general dempsey made clear think believe deeply, others knowledgeable region, way will, fact, beneficial him, translate ground; defections taking place things happen degrade capacity prosecute going forward. want emphasize something. want come back want anybody misinterpreting earlier. authorization contemplate allowance troop ground. want make absolutely clear. know, hypothesizing potential might occur point time, authorization, way -- crystal clear -- there's problem language zero capacity american troops ground within authorization president asking for. want anybody media elsewhere misinterpret coming here. said earlier, repeat now, that's important. sen. rubio: thank . -- sen. menendez (?): assure resolution. sen. /sec. kerry (?): good. sen. menendez: senator shaheen. senator jeanne shaheen (d-nh): thank , mr. chairman. thank , gentlemen, testimony. agree turn back blatant violation international norms respect use chemical weapons, stand quietly tyrant like assad uses chemical weapons people, giving carte blanche dictator anywhere world develop use chemical weapons. think question now, we've said, respond specifically? best send message completely unacceptable develop, much less use, types weapons, without inadvertently spreading conflict beyond borders syria? that's really question today. we've heard want deter future use chemical weapons, according president testimony today, want tip scales ground. ensure without spreading conflict throughout region? hit assad hard enough deter future use chemical weapons yet, affect military outcome ground? sec. kerry: well, general, want ask -- address military piece i'll take piece? gen. dempsey: sure. think language -- using american military power tip scale -- would direct action. words, resolution asking permission president able use united states' armed forces overthrow regime. hand, back earlier questions developing moderate regime capabilities stabilizing force inside syria, that's path -- military action, case, focused chemical weapons, added benefit degrading -- also added benefit supporting diplomatic track. that, let turn secretary. sec. kerry: senator shaheen, president made very, clear policy administration -- sometimes, people sort said -- know -- questioned precisely is, i'll tell precisely -- president asking congress take steps specifically deter degrade assad's capacity use chemical weapons. asking congress authorization become whole-hog involved syria's civil war, try change regime military action. targeted action deal problem chemical weapons, separate track president already committed administration country to, assad must go, lost moral authority capacity ever govern syria pursuing -- president pursuing track helping opposition, made decision lethally arm opposition upgrading efforts opposition able fight fight -- united states -- opposition -- able come negotiated settlement, president convinced, think everybody is, military solution, ultimately, want get geneva, want negotiated settlement, terms geneva one, agreement russians signed onto, calls transition government created mutual consent current regime opposition. transition government establish rules road syrian people choose new government. way possible mutual consent, assad going part future. russians agreed fact geneva i, purpose geneva ii meeting implement geneva i. now, complicated, obviously. get there? that's part struggle. president convinced support opposition increases, much greater likelihood wind ultimately negotiated settlement. alternative stand back nothing syria fact implodes, becomes enclave state, huge ungoverned spaces, al-nusra, al-qaida, hezbollah, others become threat friends region, region becomes much sectarian conflagration. part effort. sen. shaheen: thank , mr. secretary. secretary hagel general dempsey, made number statements throughout spring cautioning intervention conflict syria. feel point appropriate us take action? what's changed? sec. hagel: senator, thank . i'll let general dempsey respond himself. well, first, clear intelligence evidence assad regime used chemical weapons people. dealing new set realities, based facts. think -- least opinion -- needs addressed, needs dealt with, reasons noted -- said public also addressed statement, think -- secretary kerry general dempsey said, obviously president said. that's specific reason. dynamics changed. one additional point regard question this, previous question: fact president given authorization congress go forward -- he's already said, believes within constitutional power commander chief act well -- he's given reasons, support, came congress -- parallel actions would work along whatever action president would take: opposition strength, secretary kerry noted; second, defections within syrian government military, secretary kerry noted; intelligence, consequences. getting end game. end game diplomatic settlement. driving toward believe, president believes way this, reason secretary kerry noted: want see country syria disintegrate, result ungoverned space, think consequences would devastating partners, allies, entire middle east. would respond way. add answering last question. gen. dempsey: chairman, may -- i'll make brief, response question -- let's say past year. sen. menendez: yes, general. gen. dempsey: past year, we've provided full range options. advice options based assessment linkage national security interests whether would effective. issue, use chemical weapons, find clear linkage national security interest. find way make use force effective. sen. shaheen: thank all. sen. menendez: senator johnson. senator ron johnson (r-wi): thank , mr. chairman.  trying reconcile, guess, two tracks goals got going here, military action negotiated settlement. secretary hagel, said seeking resolve underlying conflict syria. exactly we're trying do?

gen. dempsey: well, task -- deter degrade, -- limited focused scope duration. mean, that's task i've given task i've -- sen. johnson: yes, calibrate that? gen. dempsey: well, calibrate side. always risk escalation other. significantly limited capabilities so, intelligence informs us -- could talk closed session. sen. johnson: planning undertaken right case spin control? mean, know, talking potential boots ground. secretary kerry,  glad hear bringing equation think number one national security interest, chemical weapons falling hands al-qaida elements possibly even hezbollah. commitment long- term make sure happen? limited resolution here, know we're -- prevent happening? sec. kerry: senator johnson, -- moment time -- president said, asking limited military response, recognizing neither america want dragged civil war syria. sen. johnson: goal get rid assad. sec. kerry: goal help opposition, lots -- mean, look overall. president and, think, us agree -- mean, imagine assad running syria?

gen. dempsey: seen documents lay out. sen. johnson: know hezbollah, they've cooperative assad regime -- know already access chemical weapons? feel all? sec. kerry: think need talk classified session. let say terms opposition numbers, see ranges (,), ,, , total opposition. see ranges -- well, want go numbers, tens thousands terms operative, active combatants. -- i've seen recent data numbers extremists al-nusra. they're actually lower former expectations. would also say , syria historically secular, vast majority syrians, believe, want remain secular. -- judgment -- judgment good friends actually know lot many ways better region, neighborhood --  talking saudis, emirates, qataris, turks, jordanians -- believe could fairly rapid transition, secular component syria re-emerge isolate -- sen. johnson: ok. good. tends argue robust response. final question. said world's red line. agree. intervening time period potentially act here, many additional countries supportive action? goal? right now? goal? sec. kerry: well, goal broad coalition support might possible, we're working right now. military president going decide many actually want take part action, said. already partners ready something kinetic military feels, particular operation, need effect that. now, obviously want participate want broad coalition. final numbers decided president specific operation defines together authorization. sen. johnson: ok, thank . look forward tomorrow's briefing. thanks. sen. menendez: thank . senator coons. senator christopher coons (d-de): thank , chairman menendez. i'd like thank secretaries kerry hagel chairman dempsey service nation testimony front us today. think authorization use force, think commitment american military strength one important issues ever debate congress,  grateful opportunity conversation today. secretary kerry said opening testimony, decide decide send important message around world congress still function nonpartisan way, interests people united states. i've listened delawareans recent days, think reflect nation weary war wary inadvertently repeating challenges engagement iraq. i've heard specific pointed concerns rush action based uneven inaccurate intelligence, drawn civil war fully understand can't quite discern good guys bad guys, anything, commit open-ended participation, direct military invasion occupation country part world often confounding full competing priorities. reviewed intelligence morning classified briefing, participated number briefings folks leading agencies departments, persuaded circumstance, intelligence solid, have, instance, clear violation long-standing global red line use chemical weapons -- stated, something embedded america's statutes treaty commitments, something truly global standard. view, i've watched images tv presented beginning hearing i've spoken family friends neighbors home, face real risk act, instance one world's worst dictators steadily ratcheted ascending crescendo death nation. began thugs, police military taking peaceful demonstrators, graduated snipers killing innocent civilians, used helicopters jet fighters people, deployed cluster bombs scud missiles. think last two years, doubt bashar al-assad regime willing go length stay power. challenge now, us seek appropriate path forward, make sure craft authorization use military force responds americans' legitimate concerns still allows administration act decisive timely way deter punish assad regime they've done. questions , might, first general dempsey. know we've spoken before, think worth repeating: strike right balance military action insignificant actually effectively deter degrade assad's capabilities, one decisive overwhelming reaches beyond scope authorization becomes actually regime change effort? gen. dempsey: well, senator, i'll assure , recommend option set targets effectively deter degrade. that's task i've given. -- now, we'll continue refine that, based intelligence, based resolution comes committee. sen. coons: could , view, accomplish mission, authorization limited scope terms time duration scope, discussed secretary kerry, terms introducing u.s. troops ground? gen. dempsey: well, surprise know military leader responsible this, -- broader resolution -- less limiting, better crafting set options. completely -- defer secretary state give need that. sen. coons: well, might secretary kerry, goal pass even consider authorization narrow prevents effective message sent here, said, think compelling way opening statement, actions meant deter assad, send strong message pyongyang, tehran, nonstate actors around world might use chemical weapons might seek nuclear weapons -- craft authorization? take actions effective deterring countries watching decisiveness action instant? sec. kerry: well, think language administration submitted respect military action necessary degrade deter prevent use chemical weapons specifically targeted. -- i've said several times repeat again, know administration zero intention putting troops ground, within confines authorization,  confident we'd zero problem including kind prohibition makes comfortable. would urge excessively pinpointed, congressionally- mandated set targets -- think, course classified briefings, intelligence community military community make clear that's advisable -- think general need -- latitude able make sure accomplish task. think broad confines constraints particular operation hard us arrive agreement.  confident we'll quickly. sen. coons: thank . one concerns, mr. secretary, flood refugees impact region. visit january syrian refugee camp jordan, moved humanitarian situation they're facing real impact regional allies -- jordan, turkey, destabilizing impact lebanon, course, real impact potentially going close ally, israel. encouraged hear successful missile defense system test earlier today, secretary hagel. steps taking ensure allies immediate area turkey jordan israel able defend potential response assad regime? sec. hagel: well, senator, first, jordan -- know patriot missile defense batteries jordan. also working closely israelis. know sophisticated iron dome, aerial system -- missile defense system there. constant coordination allies region, may know, general dempsey jordan commanders meeting, included senior military neighboring countries partners. closely connected assisting allies issues. sen. coons: thank . last question, secretary kerry, might. interested follow-on conversation specific strike specific authorization seeking also lead broader strategy, strategy support engagement opposition lead diplomatic resolution syrian civil war spoken repeatedly. think mutually exclusive. think possible us take action reinforces global red line chemical weapons use still continue strengthen broaden engagement opposition way moves towards post-assad syria sustainable secure. i'd look forward input us next hearing topic. sec. kerry: absolutely, senator. look forward too. i'd like get whole committee maybe come department, could, know, discussion confine committee also, think might helpful, addition classified briefing tomorrow. sen. coons: thank . sen. menendez: senator flake. sec. kerry: mr. chairman, -- want that,  happy that. sen. menendez: we'll follow up. senator flake. senator jeffry flake (r-az): thank , mr. chairman. thank testimony. want thank , particularly state department, making information available regard unclassifying certain information also classified hearings taken place regard chemical attack. think one would suspend disbelief, mentioned, assume regime charge this. secretary kerry, initial testimony, asked us ask assad's calculation would failed act. think that's appropriate question. think appropriate us ask administration, calculation assad right rather proof engage engaged in, we're waiting congressional authorization? think one would suspend disbelief assume better attacking targets right week ago waiting three weeks congress take action. drawing parallel conflict libya, think president's statement was, went ahead engaged combat least along nato, president said, refuse wait images slaughter mass graves take action without congressional authorization war powers resolution, dispute came back, initially, went ahead. evidence chemical weapons used. assure tell constituents political come, come, administration comes congress ask authorization take action president clearly said authority take?

'the conventional wisdom holds extremist elements completely mixed moderate rebel groups; case. moderates extremists wield control distinct territory. contrary many media accounts, war syria waged entirely even predominately dangerous islamists al-qaida die-hards. jihadists pouring syria countries like iraq lebanon flocking front lines. instead, concentrating efforts consolidating control northern rebel-held areas country. moderate opposition forces -- collection groups known free syrian army -- continue lead fight syrian regime. traveling free syrian army battalions, i've watched defend alawi christian villages government forces extremist groups. they've demonstrated willingness submit civilian authority, working closely local administrative councils, they've struggled ensure fight assad pave way flourishing civil society.' john, agree dr. o'bagy's assessment opposition?

sec. kerry: senator mccain, gotten know counterparts mideast particularly well number crises initiatives we've deal region. cannot emphasize enough much looking us now, making judgments us long term, critical choice make be, question syria support may may anticipate mideast peace process, future egypt, transformation middle east, stability region interests have. there's way separate one thing rest. relationships relationships integrated. that's important. sen. mccain: would also emphasize, wrong kind resolution much damage, view. thank . thank , mr. chairman. sen. menendez: thank , senator. senator udall. senator tom udall (d-nm): thank . thank , much. thank witnesses testimony service today. also want thank chairman menendez way conducted hearing. like everyone here, deplore bashar al-assad done people. attacking chemical weapons assad committed atrocious crime heinous international law singles assault deserving international action. let mistake, fully agree horrific acts deserve international response. response be?

history full opportunity moments someone stand act made difference. whether go back world war ii look ship turned away coast florida everybody lost lives subsequently german gas, things make difference. that's what's stake here. would say , know, troubling questions -- guarantee, united states act together countries, know assad do. that's guarantee. can't tell what's guaranteed country act, know happen don't.  pretty darn clear lot things people think happen happen united states acts; fact enforced international standard respect use chemical weapons. multilateral institution's set it, security council blocked it, mean turn backs say there's nothing do. that's case. bosnia made difference; saved countless numbers lives. believe, mr. -- president united states believes now. sen. udall: well, believe -- believe given easily using united nations, using -- sec. kerry: given up. sen. udall: -- yes, have. -- taken russia task. taken china task. that's pointing point. sen. menendez: time -- time senator expired. sen. udall: oh, mean -- want respectfully disagree say also much appreciate service. know trying very, hard find, diplomatic side, secretary state, peace resolution. thank courtesy. sorry going over. sen. menendez: senator barrasso. senator john barrasso (r-wy): thank much, mr. chairman. thank here. labor day weekend wyoming, heard people across state. believe happening syria awful, despicable, concerns administration plan really is, strategy really is. want know core national security interests united states stake syria, ultimate goal proposed military strikes happens strikes effective. end, mr. chairman, would -- would ask exactly going voting on. white house set forward? we're going see specifics? think senator durbin also asked narrowness expanse would -- would voting within next hours? sen. menendez: chair working ranking member others come agreed-upon text believe would meet goals achieving ability administration pursue military action sought congress' support way would allow maximum ability succeed action token tailor sufficiently open-ended engagement, specifically boots ground, american troops ground. we're yet. aspiration try get end day look forward possibility markup tomorrow. we'll see get there, we'll give members ample notice time. start morning, said, classified briefing we'll move there. sen. barrasso: thank , mr. chairman. mr. secretary, appreciate coming congress seek legislative authorization military action. president obama specifically asserted saturday already authority. now, british parliament rejected motion supporting u.k. participation, prime minister specifically said would respect british people would -- would british military intervention. president obama stand that, based -- come congress? sec. kerry: intends win passage resolution. sen. barrasso: case not, still -- plan -- sec. kerry: well, we're contemplating dire. sen. barrasso: ok. talked little bit risks delays. already reports delaying military action assad moving military assets, hardware, troops civilian neighborhoods. reports indicate russia plans send anti- submarine ship, missile cruiser, mediterranean next days. wonder means contingency planning impact going military operations. gen. dempsey: well, movement russian -- there's already four russian warships eastern med. -- staying respectful distance. see factor. sen. barrasso: administration created -- conducted, perhaps, threat assessment russia, iran, hezbollah going respond u.s.-led attack?

 wondering, limited strike, proposed, still assad goes back uses chemical weapons people -- engenders entire new set hearings? -- end? month now? gen. dempsey: well, said, senator, -- there's -- we're preparing several target sets, first would set conditions follow-on assessments, others would used necessary -- gotten point yet. know degrade disrupt capabilities put us better position make kind assessment talking about. sec. kerry: let -- let add that, can, john. senator feinstein brought today meeting white house. would really -- would sensible pass resolution view degrading degrading capacity preventing -- foolish enough again, general follow-on possibilities. since objective would remain same, it'd important assad know limited one specific moment respect chemical weapons. still limited authorization, respect chemical weapons, it'd huge mistake deprive general dempsey company options enforce we're trying achieve. sen. barrasso: trying achieve, mr. secretary -- negotiated departure assad. keep mentioning -- trying get negotiating table. seems somebody will, senator coons said, go length stay power point even using chemical weapons people -- -- driven serious level determination keep power rather negotiation table? sec. kerry: john, decent -- appropriate question. answer is, believe so, number different reasons believe so. best discussed -- look forward private session -- strong indications number -- number discussions taken place countries individuals last months assad would necessarily avoid making different decision certain circumstances. think ought leave that, private session, think ought dig it. sen. barrasso: going ask chemical weapons stockpiles -- maybe want reserve discussion tomorrow well, terms steps could take terms command control regime's chemical weapons stockpiles make sure things protected way could (potentially ?) used. sec. kerry: absolutely. want know -- is, again, something ought done session, say generically general dempsey team taken great pains, instruction president united states, make certain whatever make -- make people less safe potentially exposed weapons weapons would less control forth. things entered calculation. sen. barrasso: thank . thank , mr. chairman. sen. menendez: thank , senator barrasso. one add-on original response . resolution sent us administration resolution working on, good opening desires are, intentions are, specific resolution we'll working on. senator murphy. senator chris murphy (d-ct): thank much, mr. chairman. secretary kerry, secretary hagel, general, thank much us taking much time us. referencing conversations we've last week. i've never, frankly, seen greater level public engagement issue since, frankly, health care reform debate . certainly hard-liners come resolution go in, many resolution stay out, people see sides issue. they, frankly, appreciate fact american president taken much time put much thought arriving decision, even disagree. they, frankly, appreciate even fact president trusts trusts elected representatives enough bring conversation united states congress, albeit fact may little messy get point point b. given commotion hear constituents, that, maybe anything else, comes loud clear. guess look question, see two questions inherent one. one, ask ourselves, moral national security imperative? think plainly made case, president, atrocities committed cannot let stand country vital security interests united states. there's second question, that's one trouble think colleagues trouble with. that's this: action lessen acuity moral atrocity advance national security interest? problem needs solved way solve it. that's struggle this. frankly, think fact many others struggle question means lack courage are, frankly, enabling syrian regime. think wonder whether limit ability american military power influence politics ground middle east. clearly, though direct linkage happened iraq happened syria, chill ability people believe american military might influence politics ground syria watched last years. second problem people question escalation. think one important things, secretary kerry, said prepared remarks this. said would prepared respond to, think stated, miscalculation assad, whether reprisals people attacks allies region, would prepared respond without going war. now, people find statement little incongruous. respond without going war? let maybe ask question way. variety responses assad. could launch another chemical weapons attack people. could launch ferocious conventional weapons attack people. could -- course, allies could launch attacks allies region. expect necessarily explain exactly response today, resolution we're debating today give ability respond reprisals situations outlined, responses within syria people responses outside syria allies? would come back congress new authorization force? sec. kerry: well -- excuse me, sorry. think president made clear seen many crisis (ph) course certainly career senate, saw presidents both, supported opposed others. number occasions, presidents acted without authorization congress. question president would authority right, conceivably, imperative respond without authorization assad attack again. can't -- know, can't speak president terms decision would make, authority, right would available him. now, say quickly respect -- know, absolutely appropriate ask question: make difference -- totally appropriate -- think question escalation. let -- let say something quickly those. congress decides this, guarantee, whether assad syria, nuclear weapons iran, nuclear weapons north korea, invited for-certain confrontation point time require make choice even worse, potential even greater conflict. that, guarantee that's message sent. now, there's distinction iraq. understand iraq -- know, lived here. iraq, intelligence purported suggest weapons mass destruction existed know existed. massive invasion order try find existed. found didn't. here, weapons mass destruction know exist, used. once, twice, three times, multiple times -- estimate teens opposition estimates that. recent use weapons mass destruction contravention nearly hundred years prohibition use. sen. murphy: ok, that's -- think that's dispute. dispute there's correlation intelligence -- sec. kerry: well, dispute -- dispute going it? sen. murphy: -- ability military able influence reality ground. sec. kerry: no, no. but, chris, dispute prepared it. that's dispute. believe nothing going stand norm somehow reduce threat use future time, that's right believe that. think president believes deeply everybody table believes flies common sense human behavior. sen. murphy: mr. secretary, let ask question iran think important compelling narrative here. let ask this. circumstances different. trivialize happened syria, stakes iran obtaining nuclear weapon, could kill millions, different syria killing thousands chemical weapons. wonder whether lessens moral authority make different decision respect iran syria, decided act. second, worry weariness we've talked within american public may ultimately make harder --  saying will, could make harder us rally american public respect response iran gone could least slightly protracted engagement syria. -- guess want challenge second automatic nature failure step syria respect compromising ability respond iran. sec. kerry: well, let -- let make very, clear. world decided world war horrors gas trenches loss entire generation ng people europe would never going allow gas used warfare. sudden moment, third instance -- used adolf hitler gas millions jews; used saddam hussein order gas iraqis -- iranians people; used bashar al- assad. three people history. united states, knowing knowing we've drawn line world drawn us, unwilling stand confront that, absolute certainty gas proliferate. we've sarin gas tokyo subway. really want situation gas may available groups continues deteriorate, assad use gas continue subjugate population that's looking governance is, know, representative different respectful rights? know could live that. now, difference gas nuclear weapon? well, suppose would depend scale, honest . would depend scale. world decided chemical, biological nuclear the, know, prohibited entities warfare, nation global community struggled try enforce years. hard imagine united states would stand world that. now, going effective?  convinced reduce possibilities use gas degrade capacity use weapon. think imperative us. i've said again, take step. significantly different took place iraq originally respect weapons know existed, two similar. sen. menendez: senator paul. senator rand paul (r-ky): thank coming today. often get compliment president. probably count number times maybe one hand. first heard president going come congress, boy, pleasantly surprised. proud president. vote him, still opposed quite times, proud this. concern me. want proud president, every time  there, get worried really, mean it, he's going sort obey constitution wins. heard secretary kerry say, win, sure, lose, what? mean, make proud today, secretary kerry. stand us say, going obey constitution vote down, unlikely, do, would go people say congress, go forward war congress votes against. give better answer, secretary kerry? sec. kerry: can't give different answer one gave . know president's decision is, tell this, ought make proud, still constitutional authority, would keeping constitution. sen. paul: well, disagree there. believe constitutional authority. think congress -- this. madison explicit wrote 'the federalist papers,' wrote history supposes constitution supposes history demonstrates, executive -- branch likely go war, therefore, constitution vested power congress. explicit runs throughout madison's writings. power congressional power executive power. say big war, small war; say boots ground, boots ground. said, declare war. ask people ships launching missiles whether they're involved war not. say constitution applies, say explicitly abide vote, making joke us. making us theater. play constitutional theater president. real, abide verdict congress. probably going win; go ahead say real. let's real debate country meaningless debate end lose say, oh, well, authority anyway. we're going go ahead go war anyway. couple items -- sec. kerry: senator, assure there's nothing meaningless, everything real -- (inaudible). sen. paul: adhere vote on. vote makes difference. vote binding meaningful. sec. kerry: leave man elected president united states responsibility telling decision is, moment came. president intends win vote, he's going make prior announcement. sen. paul: we've lot discussion about, know, whether we're going make world safer this. somehow, we're going less chemical weapons. think that's open question, think conjecture best. say, oh, well, think assad less likely launch chemical weapons this. may able degrade capacity somewhat. he's got thousand tons. going wipe out? reports hear say we're even probably going directly bomb chemical weapons might happen surrounding population. guess still ability. people say assad acted illogically. would release chemical weapons people brought anger enmity entire world? he's already acting irrationally illogically, we're going deter he's going act rational manner. think equally likely either it. think say certain better. know say attacking them, he's going launch another chemical attack. sec. kerry: well -- sen. paul: region -- region -- i've got i'll stop. region stable, less stable? say want stability middle east, stability middle east national interest country. stable, less stable? frankly think equal arguments sides that. israel likely suffer attack them, gas attack otherwise, less likely? think there's valid argument saying they'll likely suffer attack this. russia likely less likely supply arms get heavily involved this? think there's valid argument may become likely involved. iran -- likely less likely involved this? iran gets involved, likely less likely israel launches reprisal attack iran? kinds unknowns can't tell absolutely answer, neither , think there's reasonable argument world may less stable may deter chemical weapons attack. would ask know? go home -- one person come say they're war, one person. get calls thousands. nobody's calling favor war. meet one home month. went cities. one person come say -- agree horrendous thing? yes, agree chemical attacks horrendous thing. people excited getting involved, also think going work. they're skeptical occur this. i'd appreciate response, try reassure rest us, one, vote meaningful valid, adhere it, also convinced different items better, worse, attack. sec. kerry: well, senator, i'd happy that. israel likely suffer attack, safer; less safe? make crystal clear israel less safe unless united states takes action. iran hezbollah two three biggest allies assad. iran hezbollah two single biggest enemies israel. -- -- iran hezbollah advantaged united states curbing assad's use chemical weapons, much greater likelihood point road, hezbollah, one principal reasons change situation ground, access weapons mass destruction. israel certain less secure. sen. paul: would also argue -- sec. kerry: let finish. sen. paul: -- would likely hezbollah attack, attack, response. sec. kerry: israel feels quite confident ability deal hezbollah so. notice israel several occasions last year seen fit deal threats security what's syria, assad responded date. think bunch things talk -- classified session. let make clear -- know, ask questions, likely happen likely happen. united states america this, senator, less likely assad again? want answer question? sen. paul: think known. think known -- sec. kerry: less likely again? sen. paul: -- (inaudible) -- attack. think unknown whether less likely (whether ?) attack. sec. kerry: unknown? senator, unknown. united states america hold accountable this, allies friends, guarantee assad again. guarantee. urge go classified briefing learn that. secondly, let point respect question americans wanting go war, know, got three people who've war. got john mccain, who's war. there's one us understand going war means, want go war. believe going war classic sense taking american troops america war. president asking authority limited action degrade capacity tyrant using chemical weapons kill people. sen. paul: think so, announce -- announce -- sec. kerry: limited -- limited. sen. paul: announce advance goal winning. sec. kerry: that's -- sen. paul: think last years secretaries defense would say goal win, involved. sec. kerry: senator, people asked, want go war syria, course not. everybody, hundred percent americans say no. say no. want go war syria either. we're ask. president asking go war. he's asking declare war. he's asking send one american troop war. he's simply saying need take action degrade capacity man who's willing kill people breaking nearly hundred-year- old prohibition, stand counted say, that. that's -- -- know, consider going war classic sense coming congress asking declaration war training troops sending people abroad putting ng americans harm's way. that's president asking here. general, want speak that, alter that? gen. dempsey: no, really, secretary. thank offering. sec. kerry: right. (laughter.) senator tim kaine (d-va): (off mic.) great. thank . good discussion. want echo senator paul, senator durbin others said: much appreciate celebrated president's decision bring matter congress. also believe others constitution reserves power initiate military action congress. five hundred thirty-five people get vote that. there's one commander-in-chief vote taken, searching inquiry. commander-in-chief decide execute decided-upon mission, applaud president it. view matter constitutional law, view reflecting important underlying value, value -- put servicemembers initiating battle -- putting people harm's way consensus behind -- american public political leadership behind them. send ng men women war military action exercising military options divided political leadership class worst thing do. need come consensus execute consensus, whatever is. would hope congress' consensus would president would otherwise. basic principle stake. think stated well: principle international law american law. use weapons mass destruction civilians. know higher principle relations states -- law nations, sort international legal morality use weapons mass destruction civilians. principle stake wrestle request president committee. principle clear. said, secretary kerry, about, weapons mass destruction exist; exist. whether exist; they've used. they've used civilians -- they've used civilians massive scale, including women children. principle squarely stake. know bashar al-assad care principle. contrary things said, know vladimir putin, shows otherwise, care principle. hope congress still cares principle. principle long-standing origin. syria signed onto it. geneva convention. soviet union signed onto geneva convention era chemical weapons convention russia leadership -- previous president, president yeltsin. know care, hope congress shows care action. couple questions. first, russia. want associate something senator udall said earlier. fact -- done enough demonstrate russia essentially become pariah nation pro-chemical weapons. hard read action come conclusion current governor -- government russia pro use chemical weapons civilians. make wear pro-chemical weapons like rotting carcass around neck every instance point they'll ask question: really want nation pro use chemical weapons civilian population? make painful ever day u.n., even they're going block come back another. make painful every day point they'll ask question: want carry water dictator who's using chemical weapons civilians? done enough score. fact they're going block us dissuade us. more. think ultimately contribute political negotiation. asked question syrian opposition's position chemical weapons unclear position chemical weapons, understand opposition may made commitments compacts negotiated, mr. secretary, anti-chemical weapons, would commit turn chemical weapons international community either take control weapons course civil war whether lead post-assad government. talk opposition commitment get rid stockpile chemical weapons currently used? sec. kerry: yeah, we've discussions that, hope president comes here, president jarba comes here, make position clear . sen. kaine: would helpful. think would one best things opposition could do, make plain. little bit confusion. think talk shorthand ways might make hard senators certainly public follow. talking military action time we're saying solution civil war that's negotiated political solution. seem odds. want state understanding fit together, tell  right wrong. take action, action degrade ability syria use chemical weapons, action degrade ability violate international law, take away significant asset battle opposition. level playing field removing ability use chemical weapons, therefore increase odds parties come table try figure political solution. connection military option proposing stated end goal solution civil war -- achieved political end? sec. kerry: collateral connection it. purpose it, collateral connection. sen. kaine: questions, mr. chair. i'll save tomorrow. sen. menendez: thank . senator markey. senator edward markey (d-ma): thank , mr. chairman, much. without question, great horror disgust assad's use chemical weapons, great sympathy people syria, leader would use chemical weapons upon people murderous regime dedicated retaining power would use weapons. time, country, great concern could invoking law unintended consequences talk using military syria. back , threat obviously next attack united states could come form mushroom -- mushroom cloud iraq. although inspectors ground days iraq -- could find war started, nonetheless, war began. think people understandably apprehensive we're talking right now, precipitate war iraq. continue look forward additional evidence presented hope act way bog us middle syrian civil war. think many people want us middle syrian civil war, many people. think american people do. think wary country drawn civil war another country. concern think many people fully understand well reaction russians action. general, -- thank , general, secretary kerry secretary hagel, -- tough job, really appreciate sensitivity professionalism handling this. talked russians four vessels eastern mediterranean, seem concerned it. syria proxy state russia. provide military assistance, training syria. concerned way strike united states could increase amount military assistance russia sends syrian regime? gen. dempsey: could, senator. mean, -- indication assured regime destroy something, replace it. know, that's reason hesitate act. -- point, there's always unintended consequences conflict, secretary mentioned, know consequences could be, probably would act. sen. markey: thank . mr. secretary -- teresa, look great. look absolutely fantastic today. understanding u.n. chemical inspection team left syria saturday u.n. secretary ban ki-moon directed team expedite mission's analysis samples information obtained. expect obtain data analysis -- made u.n., expect information made public?

(laughter.) quite this, lesson learned. assad made calculation -- inching several times, use chemical weapons, believes use chemical weapons without consequences. so, global message fact state actors nonstate actors may believe well. that's critical challenge national security united states. hope members consider move towards final action. want advise members -- think we're close text -- resolution, consider likely may well business meeting sometime classified hearing tomorrow morning. look forward working members committee. senator corker, anything else -- sen. corker: think said well enough. want thank witnesses spending much time hearing also advance hearing. look forward classified meeting tomorrow. want thank members incredible thoughtfulness throughout this, appreciate everybody coming back part taking seriously -- (inaudible). thank . sen. menendez: thanks committee, hearing adjourned. washington post company"
